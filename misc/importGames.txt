"Bulge 20 - The Ardennes Offensive" {
  41004
  <p>In Bulge 20, the Allies don’t know which German strategic objective is being pursued. Allied intelligence work is required to ascertain the real German intentions so as not to overreact to the threat, because this time, the Germans can win if their staff can outthink and outmaneuver the Allies’ staff!</p>

"Borodino 20 - Napoleon in Russia 1812" {
  38361
  <p>Designer Lance McMillan marches the Napoleonic 20 game system to the very outskirts of Moscow where a brutal campaign culminates in a titanic battle between the exhausted French Grande Armée and the entrenched Russian Army whose divided and bickering leadership has led them to this fateful moment. In Borodino 20, players can recreate the historical battle and the human foibles of the commanders fighting it. In addition, they can experiment with scenarios presuming a faster Russian response to the French threat, or Napoleon heeding the advice of his “Iron Marshal,” Davout, to try a daring flanking maneuver. Featuring only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and “friction of war” which gives players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!</p>

  <p>The Napoleonic 20 game system expands with France’s long-planned invasion of England finally launched! With only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns providing the operational pauses and “friction of war” that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic campaign as the armies close for battle. With his newly trained and organized Grande Armée, Napoleon masses his forces in Boulogne for the great invasion. The Franco-Spanish fleet arrives on time to seize control of the English Channel, and a hell-for-leather landing is made aimed straight at London – the Kent Campaign ensues! With special post-landing maneuvering and naval conflict abstractions, Albion 20 adds many fascinating new features to simulate this campaign. Will the Emperor finally triumph over his archrival, “Perfidious Albion?” Or will there always be an England?</p>

"Jena 20 - Napoleon in Prussia" {
  34747
  <p>Jena 20 is the second title featuring Joseph Miranda’s innovative Napoleonic 20 game system. With only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns providing the operational pauses and “friction of war” that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic campaign as the armies close for battle. Following France’s glorious victory against the combined Austro-Russian armies at Austerlitz the previous December, the Prussians have finally come off the fence and declared war against Napoleon. As both sides maneuver, uncertain of the location or center of gravity of the opposing army, they meet in a dramatic double battle on the fields of both Jena and Auerstadt. Can the heirs of Frederick the Great maintain their composure and cohesion long enough to teach the haughty French a lesson, or will Napoleon and his Marshals ride on to ever greater glory?</p>

A 6-year struggle for the survival of democracy, freedom and basic human decency ensued, costing 100 million lives. It was a close-run thing.</p><p>Untold thousands of acts of bravery, resolution and sacrifice had telling effects in battle. Others had none. Technical advances had a profound impact (we know now that code-breaking played a key role).</p><p>But in the end, it is very possible that the issue was decided by strategy.</p>

  <p>On June 18, 1815, one of the most decisive battles in military history was fought in Belgian fields twenty miles southeast of Brussels. Within a short 100 days, Napoléon, former emperor of France, had returned from exile on the island of Elba, again seized power, quickly assembled an army, and marched to defeat the dispersed British and Prussian armies now preparing to invade France.</p><p>Napoléon invaded Belgium on June15th, defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny on the 16th and after a day of pursuit, faced the British and Dutch army commanded by Wellington. Aided by superb defensive tactics and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, Wellington defeated the French in the great Battle of Waterloo, ending forever the military ambitions of the great Napoléon.</p>

  <p>With the Danube campaign over and the Austrian capital of Vienna occupied by French troops, Napoleon requires a decisive battlefield victory to secure his gains. At the end of a long line of communication back to Paris, the Grande Armée feigns weakness in the cold and fog of an early December morning in 1805. Now Austerlitz 20 presents the story of desperation and destiny as three Emperors clash to resolve the fate of Europe. With its myriad scenarios and variations, students of history can explore a plethora of "What if?" possibilities as Allied greatness clashes with French glory at the dawn of the "Sun of Austerlitz."</p>

The expanding Napoleonic 20 game system poses a desperate, large-scale confrontation in Vittoria 20 – a ‘last stand’ battle where both sides require steel nerves and sabers to protect (or capture) the massive horde of Spanish plunder. The demoralized French have concentrated their forces, but the British attack is ferocious. Who will take the prize?</p>

"Successors" {

  <p>When Alexander the Great died in 323 BC, he left no clear heir to the immense empire he had conquered. It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander’s empire. By 305 BC they had given up on that endeavor and began to carve out their own kingdoms. SUCCESSORS is a four-player game based on those wars. Each player controls a faction of two or more generals and attempts to win the game through legitimacy or conquest.</p>

"Struggle of Empires" {
  9625
  <p>Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war players must form into two alliances.</p><p>Once allied with a player you cannot fight each other. This means you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he’s allied he’s with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn’t really want to fight him.</p><p>On top of this you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution. Even though it is a big empire building game it will scale from 2 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules.</p>

"1805, Sea of Glory" {
  23685
  <p>Spring, 1805 - Napoleon’s Grande Armée is encamped along the shores of the English Channel. Following the teachings of Alexander the Great, the French Emperor seeks to defeat a naval power from the land. He has but to place 100,000 troops on British soil and France’s hereditary enemy will finally fall. To do this, his combined fleet must control the Channel long enough for hundreds of shallow draft boats to ferry his troops to England. Standing in the Emperor’s way is the Royal Navy.</p><p>The year 1805, which is punctuated by the British naval victory at Trafalgar, represents England’s darkest time during the Napoleonic Wars. The threat of invasion looms large. Her great Wooden Walls offer the island nation its only defense against a far superior foe.</p><p>1805: Sea of Glory examines the naval war on an operational level during that pivotal year. Although Trafalgar shines through history as the beacon of victory, it is the successful blockade of enemy ports that kept French boots from stepping onto British soil. But 1805: Sea of Glory is more than a game about blockade duty. It is a game of breakout and pursuit, deception and false leads, husbanding meager resources, striking a blow where your enemy least suspects, and bringing about the decisive naval battle that defines victory or defeat.</p>

Each player controls one or more major powers that dominated Europe at the time. The major powers represented are the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, England, France, the Papacy and the Protestant states.</p>

"Thirty Years War - Europe in Agony" {
  2748
  <p></p> direct descendant of Paths of Glory, 30 Years War covers the confusing post-Reformation conflict in central Europe, as the Holy Roman Empire attempts to reassert domination over the protestant states. On the side of Catholicism we have the Holy Roman Empire (Austria and some of Northern Italy at this point) and Spain, opposed by a cast of thousands: the German Protestants, Sweden at the height of her power, France, England, Denmark, and others.</p><p>While there are some new mechanics, virtually the entire game is borrowed from elsewhere: Leader activations and movement are as in Hannibal, combat is straight out of Paths of Glory (minus the flanking), and Siege resolves much Hannibal. Your armies have to be paid, with Aid Points that are received just like Paths of Glory's RPs. An interesting twist is that the movement and support of armies results in the landscape getting Pillaged, so as the game goes on the board becomes less and less capable of supporting military operations.</p>

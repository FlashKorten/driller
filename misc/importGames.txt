    description{<p>Military historians generally agree that the Battle of Britain proper got under way on 8 August 1940. On that day, and on 11 August, the Luftwaffe performed heavy raids against British ports and airfields as a sort of dress rehearsal for the planned Adler Tag (Eagle Day). During these operations, the Germans were startled by the quick response of the RAF to their raids and correctly concluded that the excellent British radar net was responsible. Therefore, on 12 August, intense raids were conducted against radar stations stretching from Land's End to the mouth of the Thames in preparation for the knockout blow to come.</p>}

Unknown to the Germans, the RAF was hurting, not due to lack of airplanes, but the lack of experienced pilots. Instead of continuing raids against targets that directly affected RAF operations, Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to direct its power against civilian targets such as London and other major cities. This decision was made partly in response to British bombing of Berlin, which infuriated the Fuhrer.

  title{"Roads to Leningrad ~ Battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russa, 1941"}
  description{<p>During the summer of 1941, the forces of German Army Group North appeared to be advancing irresistibly toward Leningrad, the second largest city in the Soviet Union, and the birthplace of the Communist revolution. But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.</p><p>In mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.</p><p>In August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective. When the Germans did reach Leningrad, they lacked the strength to break into the city itself.</p><p>The battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russia may well have saved Leningrad.</p>}

    description{<p>To relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad, in early August the Soviet High Command (STAVKA) prepared a surprise counter-offensive near Staraya Russa, south of Lake Ilmen. For this offensive STAVKA assigned the 34th Army (Lt. Gen. Kachanov) to augment the 11th Army (Lt. Gen. Morozov) then already in position. On 12 August the attack began, initially with eight divisions, eventually with ten, tearing into German Gen. Hansen’s X Corps’ southern flank. His three divisions, exhausted from their frontal attack on Staraya Russa, were outnumbered. Within two days Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles, severing all contact with German II Corps to the south.</p><p>While Berlin had originally ordered the formation of a purely defensive front south of Lake Ilmen, the developing crisis caused a re-examination. By 14 August, the crisis was causing concern in both Berlin and in Feldmarshal von Leeb’s Army Group North Headquarters. Leeb ordered the SS Totenkopf Division from reserve to a more forward position, to counter further Soviet westward moves, but this was not enough. By the next day Hitler demanded the transfer of a full panzer corps in reaction to the Soviet threat, and to Hansen’s continuing requests for help. Later on the 15th, Leeb thought he would be able to send reinforcements instead to the German breakthrough on the lower Luga, aimed at Leningrad, but by the end of the day, Leeb had revised his estimate: the Soviets had managed a breakthrough, and X Corps was in trouble. X Corps would receive heavy support from the Luftwaffe, and Manstein’s LVI Corps would be sent to restore the situation. This removal of German strength from the assault on Leningrad probably saved the city from German occupation.</p>}

His plan was to make contact on his left with the westernmost elements of Hansen’s X Corps’ fragmented divisions, now facing south, and strike at the Soviet rear with is main effort.</p><p>On the previous day, the 18th, Hansen had succeeded in holding his positions, but only because the Luftwaffe had given its full support to his beleaguered corps. Meanwhile, the SS Totenkopf Division and Hansen’s 30th Infantry Division had closed the dangerous gap at Gorki.</p><p>On the 19th Manstein’s counter-attack began, with the 3 Motorized Division on Manstein’s right, and Totenkopf on the left. In support was a mixed, brigade-sized Kampfgruppe under the command of General Lieb. Hansen’s X Corps formed the anvil for the hammer blow. The Soviets were taken completely by surprise. Three days later it was all over. Between them the two German corps had severely battered both the 11th and 34th Armies, taking more than 18,000 prisoners, capturing or destroying over 300 artillery pieces and anti-tank guns, 200 tanks, 36 anti-aircraft guns, and almost 700 other motor vehicles.</p><p>The Soviet offensive had not affected the eastern pincer of the German drive on Leningrad, which reached Lake Ladoga and isolated the city, as planned. It had, however, deprived the Germans of the reserve that they needed for the western pincer to advance from the lower Luga through the fortified areas in front of Leningrad, and on into the city. Manstein’s Corps was now 160–200 miles from where it was needed most. Even worse for the German chances to take Leningrad, when Manstein reached the Lovat River, his corps was ordered to join in yet another battle to the east against the elusive 11th, 34th, and now 27th Armies. This battle stretched on into the Valday Hills, a region of intensely difficult terrain, and even farther from Leningrad.</p>}

  description{<p>When the Allied forces landed on the coast of Algeria and Morocco on November 8, 1942 (Operation Torch), it seemed that the war in North Africa would only last a few weeks. The Axis defeat appeared inevitable. Instead, German and Italian reinforcements rushed to Tunisia, creating a new front that stopped the Allied advance. In addition, Rommel's veterans of Panzerarmee Afrika withdrew from Libya to join hands with troops already in Tunisia, thereby giving Axis forces an opportunity for strategic advantage.</p><p>Axis Command thought it had a realistic chance for victory with unified forces by separating and defeating each Allied army in detail, starting with the inexperienced US forces. On Valentine's Day 1943, the most dangerous of these Axis offensives began. Had it succeeded, the war in North Africa would have been lengthened, possibly delaying the Allied invasion of Europe. This offensive offered the Axis a chance for a major battlefield success to offset the disaster at Stalingrad. Kasserine proved to be the last realistic chance for the Axis to reverse their fortunes in North Africa.</p><p>Kasserine is an operational-level game of the WWII German and Italian offensive in central Tunisia that took place in February 1943. The game is intended for two players. One player controls the Axis forces of Germans and Italians, and his opponent controls the Allied forces of Americans, British, and French. The players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play.</p>}

Luftflotte 4 flew 2,000 sorties on 14 October and 600 tons of bombs were dropped by German Stukas.

With the Tractor Factory nearly surrounded, the intensity of the attack effectively split the soviet 62nd Army in two. Knowing that the loss of the Tractor Factory would lead to the collapse of the Soviet's right flank, General von Paulus ordered fresh troops forward to dislodge the last Soviet troops entrenched there.

In a matter of days, 4th Panzer Army, with the 29th Motorized Division in the lead, headed for the river south of the city, effectively trapping Lieutenant General Chuikov and the men and women of the 62nd Army. Stalin's order of July 27 - "Not a step back!" - was no longer just an obligation but a necessity, and its slogan "There is no land behind the Volga!" the harsh reality that now faced all of the city's inhabitants.</p><p>Having witnessed firsthand on the Russian steppe the devastating effectiveness of German Blitzkrieg tactics, Chuikov turned the carpet-bombing of the city to his advantage. Anchoring his defense lines in bombed-out buildings that overlooked strategically important streets and squares, he ordered Soviet troops to "hug the enemy". Always keeping the front lines as close to the Germans as physically possible, often a mere floor or door frame away, he successfully negated much of the Germans' firepower and combined arms superiority. At such a close range, German infantry soon found themselves forced to fight on their own; or risk taking casualties from their own close air and artillery support! Key landmarks, such as the South Railway Station - which changed hands 14 times in 6 hours; and the Grain Elevator - where combat raged for weeks, became part of history. A year later, the city's defenders were collectively recognized for their courage with the gift of a ceremonial broadsword whose etching reads: "To the steel-hearted citizens of Stalingrad - the gift of King George VI - in token of the homage of the British people."</p>}

The Persian fleet unter the joint command of Datis and Artaphernes landed near Marathon bay, which offered a perfect battleground for their troops. The Athenians marched out to face the enemy in the field, with 1000 allied soldiers from Plataea supplementing the Athenian force of 9000. The Persians outnumbered the Greeks, but to counter the disparity, Callimachus extended the Greek line to match the enemy, thinning the center while keeping both wings at full strength. The Persian army, with its best troops in the center, was taken by surprise when the Athenians attacked. Historians suggest that some of the Persian cavalry was in the process of embarking back onto the ships when the attack started. In the battle the Persian center got the best of the weak Greek center and broke through, but this success was more than countered by the defeat of their two wings. The victorious Athenians then swung inwards and the Persian force was routed back to their ships. Concerned that the defeated Persians might still sail around to threated Athens, Pheidippides ran the 26 miles back to Athens with the news of the victory, running the first Marathon race. Greece was safe, for now.</p>}

King Hamilcar of Carthage, an ally and friend of Terillus, led an army to Sicily in 480 BC to restore him to power. Hamilcar established two camps to the west and southwest of Himera. As the armies skirmished outside the city, Gelon's raiders captured a message providing the date of arrival of a body of Greek cavarly reinforcing Hamilcar's army. A treacherous plan was hatched to substitute Gelon's own cavalry for these reinforcements. At dawn on the specified day, Gelon's horsemen entered the Punic sea-camp without raising any suspicion. They suddenly attacked, raising havoc and killing Hamilcar. Meanwhile the rest of Gelon's army launched a surprise attack against both camps. Most of the forces in the sea-camp were slaughtered but a successful counter-attack at the hill camp prevented the total destruction of the Carthaginian army. A peace treaty was signed between Syracuse and Carthage, which held for seven decades. Since Hamilcar's expedition coincided with the Xerxes' invasion, it was believed to be part of a coordinated assault on the Greek world.</p>}

However, following the loss of the Persian fleet at Salamis (480), Xerxes withdrew to Asia and left Mardonius with most of the Persian land forces to continue the subjugation of Greece. Amid much bickering, an allied Greek army was formed under the Spartan Pausanias, and moved to oppose the Persians. The Greeks were always careful to stay in terrain that negated the Persian cavalry. The Persian cavalry attacked anyway, but their commander Masistias was killed. Ceasing direct combat, the Persian cavalry began raiding effectively, poisoning the Greek's water supply and destroying a large Greek baggage train. Short of water and food, Pausanias ordered a night withdrawal, but only the allies in the center did so. The Spartan right and Athenian left stood until first light. Seeing this confusion Mardonius ordered a general advance, and attacked the Athenians units on the Greek left wing. It was a fierce onslaught that prevented the Athenians from moving to assist the Spartans who were being pressed hard on the right. Holding back until the omens were right, the Spartans were finally ordered to charge, routing all before them and killing Mardonius. The sight of Persians retreating unnerved Artabazus' forces and they also fled the field. The victory at Plataea meant the Persian threat to Greece was effectively ended.</p>}

However, Spartan arrogance following this victory led to the outbreak of hostilities with her former ally, Thebes. In 371 King Cleombrotos of Sparta marched against Thebes. When he reached Leuctra he found the Theban army barred his way. The Spartans deployed in a long line with their allies on the left. Greek commanders traditionally placed their best troops on the right, and this wing usually led the attack. The brilliant Theban commander, Epaminondas,devised an innovative plan to mass his best men on the left in a 50-man deep phalanx. He intended to meet Spartan shock with super shock. Both sides sent their cavalry out and the Spartan horse were quickly defeated. Seeing his cavalry fail, Cleombrotos ordered his infantry to advance. Simultaneously, Epaminondas' massed left advanced against the Spartan right, while the rest of his army was ordered to hold back, in an oblique order. The Spartans were attempting to change formation to deal with the situation when the Sacred Band charged and hit them in mid-maneuver. Cleombrotos was killed and the massive weight of the Theban phalanx broke the Spartan line. Never before had Sparta experienced such a defeat, and Leuctra shattered the myth of Spartan military invincibility.</p>}

A division in the Arcadian league led Mantinea to ally with Sparta. Sparta's hereditary enemy, Athens, even joined in the alliance against Thebes. Epaminondas invaded in 362 to reassert Theban dominance. In a plain near Mantinea he encountered the enemy force fo 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse with the Mantineans on the right, Spartans in the center, and Athenians on the left. Epaminondas' force of 30,000 foot and 3,000 horse was deployed with massive depth on his left, the same tactic he had used successfully at Leuctra. The Thebans closed in on the Mantinean wing and then grounded arms as if not to battle this day. Once the Mantineans relaxed their guard, Epaminondas suddenly ordered the attack. The onslaught broke the Mantinean right flank, leading to the defeat of the entire Spartan army. Disastrously for Thebes, Epaminondas was killed in the closing moments of the battle. Sparta had been humbled again, but without her brilliant leader, Thebes was unable to maintain her hegemony over Greece.

Philip aggressively expanded Macedonian control which brought him into conflict with the Athenians. In 352, Philip turned southwest into Thessaly.

The Phocian lines began to withdraw and then broke and fled to the sea where many tried to swim out to the Athenian fleet that had just arrived. Onomarchus died fighting, and Macedon now dominated all of Thessaly. Philip had demonstrated the superiority of a combined arms force against a traditional Greek hoplite army.

The Persian cavalry were deployed along the bank and the infantry some distance to the rear. Alexander placed his heavy infantry in the center and light infantry and cavalry on the wings. Parmenio commanded the defensive left and Alexander the overloaded right. The initial Macedonian attack across the river was repulsed. Alexander then led the Companion cavalry in a ferocious assault on the Persian leaders who were now grouped closely together. Mithridates, Darius' nephew, struch the Macedonian king with a javelin, but Alexander slew him with a sword stroke. Phoesaces then managed to deliver a blow that split Alexander's helmet. As Alexander struck Rhoesaces down, Spithradates came from behind and raised his scimitar to finish off the Macedonian king. However, Alexander's bodyguard Cleitus struck the Persian noble with such power that he severed his arm. The death of these three leaders was too much for the Persian cavalry and they broke and fled. So did the Persian foot. Only the Greek mercenaries held their ground. When they asked for quarters, none was given, and they were butchered almost to the man.

Alexander turned to meet Darius at the Pinarus River.

Alexander's advance was slow at first, but when he realized the Persian units in the hills were no threat, he ordered the charge toward the Greek mercenaries. The Macedonian phalanx initially had a tough time against Darius' Greek mercenaries, but Alexander broke through with his Companions and took the mercenaries in the flank.

Darius had raised another army, strong in cavalry but lacking in good infantry. The two armies met on the plain of Gaugamela.

Alexander placed the Thessalian horse on the left, while taking charge of the phalanx in the center and the Companions on the right in person. The Persian line extended well beyond both flanks of the Macedonian formation. To counter, Alexander moved diagonally as he advanced, refusing his left. Darius ordered his mounted troops forward. The Macedonian right managed to hold their attackers just long enough for Alexander to charge with his Companions and heavy infantry straight for Darius. Again, Darius turned and fled the field, but the battle was not quite over. The Macedonian left was still hard pressed by the Persian cavalry. Alexander wheeled about and charged with the Companions into the Persians, forcing them back. Soon the entire Persian army was in retreat.

Alexander decided to attack and defeat the barbarians to dissuade them from future raids. Alexander set up catapults to deal with the horse-archers during their potentially difficult river crossing. When the catapults opened fire, a number of Scythian horsemen were immediately struck down. The horse-archers cautiously backed away from the river. Alexander's troops quickly crossed en masse. Once safely across, he sent out a few units of horse and foot as bait. When the Scythians, as expected, had surrounded the Macedonian detachment, Alexander sent in the rest of his horse and light infantry to block their retreat so they could not avoid Alexander's heavy foot units. After some brief hand-to-hand fighting, Satraces was killed and the Scythians broke and fled. Although the bulk of the Scythian army escaped, they knew that the Macedonians could beat their tactics.

The elephants charged the phalanx and did great execution among the elite Macedonian infantry. Only the timely intervention of the light troops prevented greater loss. Porus, wounded six times, was captured and the remainder of his army routed. Porus so impressed Alexander with his bravery that he was allowed to retain his kingdom as a Macedonian vassal.

The following year, Antigonus emerged early from winter quarters and force marched across the desert to catch Eumenes off guard. Eumenes detected the move and the two armies closed on a salt plain near Gabiene. Antigonus' force had 22,000 infantry, 9,000 horse and 65 elephants. Eumenes' army was down to 17,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry and 114 elephants. Both sides deployed in a classic Alexandrian set up. The battle opened with the skirmishers and elephants engaging in a confused melee. Antigonus' cavalry charged home against Eumenes' left wing cavalry, routing it. In the center Eumenes' Silver Shields prevailed again in an infantry attack that forced back the Antigonid phalanx. Meanwhile, Antigonus' cavalry force was pressing in on both flanks and also captured Eumenes' baggage train (camp). It had been another close battle but Antigonus had prevailed. Antigonus negotiated with the Silver Shields to exchange their commander for their captured baggage, and Eumenes was betrayed and put to death. Antigonus was now the undisputed leader of the Asian satrapies, and would soon make a bid to reclaim all of the Empire of Alexander for himself.</p>}

With the most powerful army of all the contenders, Antigonus made a bid to reunify the empire under his dominion in 302 BC. The other four Diadochi kings had formed an alliance to stop him. The allies met Antigonus' army near Ipsus. The armies were evenly matched in foot, with the allies superior in horse and greatly superior in elephants. As the battle began, Antigonus' cavalry charged against one of Seleucus' cavalry wings, routing it. Unfortunately, the Antigonid cavalry pursued too far, and then could not re-enter the battle because they were blocked by Seleucid elephants. This left Antigonus' phalanx unsupported as the allied phalanx charged forward. Overwhelmed, Antigonus was killed and his phalanx broken. The remaining horse and some of the foot escaped, along with a young general who would make his presence felt later -- Pyrrhus. With three kings and three future kings present, this had truly been "the Battle of the Kings." The 81-year old Antigonus had never before lost a battle. His defeat and death brought an end to the first phase of the Successor Wars and dashed any hope that the empire would be reunified.</p>}

In 297 BC he regained his ancestral kingdom, and went on to seize the throne of Macedon. By 284 he was driven out of Macedon, and looking for new adventures. When Rome threatened expansion in southern Italy, Pyrrhus accepted an invitation from Tarentum to lead their fight in 281 BC. His campaign started badly when his invasion army of 25,000 foot, 3,000 horse and 20 elephants was scattered in its sea crossing, and he discovered a "wait and see" attitude among his erstwhile Greek allies in Italy. Pyrrhus needed a quick victory to change their attitude. Laevinus moved south to deal with the Epirote invader with a Roman army of two legions and allies -- about 25,000 men. Both armies met near the river Siris. Pyrrhus could not prevent the Romans from crossing. In the early stage of the battle the Romans were getting the best of it, when Pyrrhus played his trump card and sent forward the elephants. No Roman soldier had seen one before and they were too much for the foot and cavalry alike. The Roman rout was on. There is little doubt the elephants were the key to Pyrrhus' victory, but it had been a bloody and hard-fought battle -- 7,000 Romans and 4,000 Greeks were left on the field. The victory swelled Pyrrhus' ranks with new allies, but Rome was far from beaten.</p>}

Pyrrhus, at the forefront of the fighting, was wounded, preventing him from exploiting his victory. Over 6,000 Romans had been slain, but Pyrrhus had lost 3,500 of his men, mostly irreplaceable veterans and many of his officers. Pyrrhus reportedly exclaimed after the battle "One more such victory and I shall be lost!" giving rise to the term "Pyrrhic Victory."

Dentatus led his forces out and drove back Pyrrhus' vanguard. As the Roman attack continued it was in turn driven back by Pyrrhus' skillful use of his elephants. However, a second Roman assault stampeded the elephants into the Macedonian phalanx. Dentatus struck while the phalanx was disordered and broke it, winning the battle. Pyrrhus withdrew from the field with what was left of his army and returned to Epirus, never to return to Italy.

The two armies met at Raphia on the Egyptian frontier. Both armies deployed with their phalanx in the center and cavalry on the wings. Antiochus began the battle by charging forward with his right wing cavalry and breaking Ptolemy's left. The young Antiochus impetuously pursued the fleeing cavalry before him. Meanwhile, the Egyptian right swung forward into action and defeated its counterpart. With both wings wheeling in opposite directions, Ptolemy ordered his center to attack. Surprisingly, the Egyptian phalanx got the best of the veteran Seleucids and Antiochus' entire army broke and fled. Antiochus withdrew, and Ptolemy recovered Judea. Despite this defeat, Antiochus went on to re-conquer his lost provinces and restore the great Seleucid Empire.

The two armies were nearly identical in size, with around 23,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry each. The battle would be won by the superior tactical system, not weight of numbers. Still, the hilly Greek terrain at Cynoscephalae did favor the legion. The two armies were marching on opposite sides of a ridgeline and met unexpectedly in the early morning mist. A skirmish began between light troops, and Philip decided to commit his entire army. Philip took command of the right wing and successfully attacked the Roman left. Flaminius seized the initiative and launched an attack spearheaded by elephants on the left flank phalanx, breaking it before it was fully deployed. Each army's right wing was now victorious. An unknown Roman tribune, 'seeing what ought to be done' detached some maniples from the Roman right to strike the flank of the victorious Macedonaian right wing phalanx.

Meanwhile, Macedon's defeat at Cynoscephalae in 197 BC left a power vacuum in Greece. Antiochus, seeing an opportunity, invaded Greece, but Rome quickly drove him back. A Roman consular army under Lucius Cornelius Scipio pursued Antiochus to Asia Minor. Antiochus accepted the Roman challenge near Magnesia. Antiochus fielded a large army featuring his Greco-Macedonian phalanx, Galatian warriors, cataphracts, chariots and elephants. The Romans had two legions supported by Greek and Pergamene allies under their king Eumenes II. Though the Seleucid Army was larger, the Roman legionnaires, veterans of the war with Hannibal, were far more effective soldiers. The action started on the Roman right when Eumenes launched a combined skirmisher and cavalry force against the Seleucid chariots. The Legions then moved forward against the Seleucid phalanx. Seeing his army giving away, Antiochus charged forward with his heavy cavalry in an attempt to turn the tide. He broke through the Roman right, but was forced back by the Roman elephants before he could flank the Legions.

Thousands of Cimbri were taken prisoner while many more were slain, including Beorix. As a result, the tribes from the north ceased to pose a threat to Roman expansion. Disputes over the credit for this great victory sowed the seeds of the later Civil War between Marius and Sulla.</p>}

    description{<p>The greatest slave revolt against Rome was led by a gladiator named Spartacus. The was a Thracian slave, trained as a gladiator by his owner, Lentulus Batiatus, at a gladiator school near Capua. Spartacus escaped from the school with 78 fellow gladiators. After some successful skirmishes with local guards, his force set about raiding the countryside, freeing more slaves to join their ranks. Spartacus set up a base on the defensible slopes of Mount Vesuvius. Remembering the earlier Slave Wars in Sicily, the Senate in Rome took this outbreak seriously. They dispatched Praetors Claudius Glaber and Publius Varinius with 3,000 men to suppress the uprising. Glaber and Varinius blockaded Spartacus at his base on Mount Vesuvius, intending to starve out the slaves since their camp was only accessible by a narrow and difficult passage. The wily Spartacus did not intend to be starved into submission, so he devised a daring plan. He ordered ladders to be made from the vines that grew on Vesuvius. Spartacus and most of his followers quietly descended the vine ladders, undetected by the Romans. Soon, a picked force of the slaves rushed the Roman camp from the mountain. Once the Romans were fully occupied by this attack, Spartacus and his force struck unexpectedly. Attacked from both sides, the Roman camp fell in short order. This victory over regular Roman forces allowed Spartacus to expand his operations and recruit a massive slave army.</p>}

He divided his ever-growing army and placed his lieutenant, Crixus, a Gaul, in charge of a force of 30,000 German and Gallic slaves, while he maintained personal command of the remaining 40,000 fighters. Crixus was over-confident after their many victories and allowed Spartacus to march far ahead while he allowed his men to continue their raiding and plundering. The consul Lucius Gellius Publicola came upon them suddenly and forced a battle. Crixus hastily formed his available men into a line of battl, but Publicola's legionnaires cut them to pieces.

To the north, his fellow consul Glaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus moved to block Spartacus' path. The Roman plan was initially successful. Spartacus was cornered, and the two Roman armies advanced to within sight of each other. Unfortunately, the Roman commanders, disdainful of Spartacus' abilities, became too clever for their own good. They left an inviting gap between the two Roman armies, as if in error, to invite Spartacus to attack between both armies. Spartacus had other ideas. He split his army, leaving a small force to keep Lentulus busy, while he led the main attack against Gellius. Outnumbered, this Roman army was defeated. Spartacus then turned his troops against Lentulus. The second army was also smashed. The Roman leaders escaped capture, but large numbers of prisoners and much equipment fell into the hands of the slave army.

How all this would translate into military success was anybody's guess, but many noble volunteers flocked to join his army of six legions. Meanwhile, the victorious slave army was marching southward again. Spartacus proposed a negotiated settlement, but Crassus refused to consider it. Next, Crassus assigned two of the legions to his deputy, Mummius, and gave him the task of harassing the flank of the slave army. Mummius was to slow down the slave army while the main force under Crassus waited on the border of Picenum, expecting Spartacus would come back that way. Unfortunately, Mummius wanted to maximize his own glory and foolishly attacked, even though outnumbered. His detachment was routed, and many of his legionnaires survived only by abandoning their arms and fleeing. Crassus subjected the remnants of Mummius' legions to decimate, a harsh punishment not used in many years. One man in each squad of ten was chosen by lot and executed before the whole army.

The Roman army built a wall and ditch across the isthmus, some 30 kilometers in length. Spartacus was walled in, but he did not attempt to break out until his provisions began to fail. After two strenuous efforts to break free, his main force still remained trapped. Waiting and watching for a weak spot, the opportunity came one snowy night.

The Germans constructed a camouflaged sod wall to improve the already ideal ambush site. The seemingly loyal Arminius accompanied Varus' march column until one night he and his German auxiliaries disappeared.

Still, it was not until the early hours of the next morning that the Samnites and the Marian forces were broken. In the aftermath, Sulla's enemies in Rome were rooted out and eliminated, leaving him with absolute power as dictator.</p>}

Marcus Perpenna arrived from Italy to reinforce Sertorius with a small army and a large number of outlawed "populares" nobles.

Although Sertorius' forces succeeded, Pompey thought that he had trapped the enemy between the city and his army. Pompey, disdainful of Sertorius and his army, sent a message to the citizens of Lauron, for them to come to the city walls and watch the destruction of Sertorius. Pompey, however, was so intent on his move to trap Sertorius that he failed to observe a hidden force of 6000 Sertorian soldiers. These troops burst from cover and attacked the rear of Pompey's army. At the same time, Sertorius' cavalry charged home. Pompey was forced to retire in disorder, and could only watch as Lauron was captured and burned to the ground.</p>}

Foolishly, Curio launched an attack on this much larger Numidian force.

Caesar directed his next campaign against these Pompeian and allied Numidian forces. Once Caesar had transported his entire army to Africa, he set off with a sizeable force on a foraging expedition. They had gone a few miles when a much larger enemy force of Numidian cavalry and light troops deployed for battle to his front. The Numidians were commanded by Titus Labienus, formerly Caesar's deputy in Gaul and his opponent at Dyrrhachium and Pharsalus.</p><p>The enemy formation and tactics were quite novel to Caesar. The Numidian cavalry was interspersed with light infantry and would rush forward to throw their javelins. When the Romans charged, the enemy would retire. Meanwhile, the exposed Roman flanks were pelted by other enemy units. As the battle progressed, because of their numbers, the Numidian cavalry had almost surrounded Caesar's troops. Caesar countered by forming his line back to back and gradually retired toward his camp. At this point in the battle, the Numidians grew stronger yet when Marcus Petreius arrived with elite cavalry and more Numidian infantry. True to his nature, Caesar encouraged his utterly exhausted troops to make one last effort to drive the enemy back. The Roman attack succeeded, allowing them to withdraw. Caesar had lost nearly a third of his detachment and gained a healthy respect for his adversaries.</p>}

    description{<p>Following his set-back at Ruspina, Julius Caesar spent some time regrouping before making a surprise night march of 16 miles and camping near the Pompeian-held coastal town of Thapsus. Caesar immediately placed Thapsus under siege. Though numerically superior, Metellus Scipio, the Pompeian commander in the area, originally had no intention of risking a direct battle with the formidable Caesar. However, Caesar had forced the issue with his threat to Thapsus. If Scipio allowed a key city to fall without a fight, then key allies woiuld defect to Caesar. Scipio reluctantly brought his 40,000 man army up to relieve the city.</p><p>Scipio occupied a defensive position and drew up his line wit elephants (provided by King Juba) on the wings. Caesar opposed the pachyderms with light archers and slingers, while taking personal command of his right wing. As the battle began, volleys of missiles sent the elephants reeling. At nearly the same time, Caesar's infantry, eager for battle, attacked without orders. Many of the elephants stampeded into the center of Caesar's line, where the 5th legion Alaudae (the Larks) was advancing. The 5th was a Gallic legion, recruited in Transalpine Gaul. The Larks bravely stood firm against the elephants, and later adopted the elephant as their legionary symbol. Caesar's horse countered a Numidian cavalry charge and forced them to flee. After the failed charge, the Pompeian line crumbled and the rout was on. Pompeian resistance in Africa had been crushed, but the civil war was not quite over. There remained one more Pompeian bastion - Spain.</p>}

Here, the garrison legions had revolted in favor of Gnaeus Pompey, the eldest son of Pompey the Great. Pompey gathered a large but largely inexperienced army of thirteen legions. Caesar traveled to Spain to put a final end to Pompeian resistance. He brought three of his crack veteran legions, the 5th, 6th and 10th, but most of his army was also composed of newer recruits. The initial campaign was marked by extreme brutality by both sides, but no decisive battles were fought until Caesar brought Gnaeus Pompey to bay near Munda.</p><p>Pompey deployed in a strong hill top position so Caesar was faced with an uphill battle. Rather than maneuver for advantage, Caesar uncharacteristically ordered a frontal assault on the strong enemy position. Caesar's cavalry and light troops attacked both enemy wings but gained no advantage. Some of the hardest fighting in Caesar's life unfolded as the two armies slogged it out. The Pompeians fought with true desperation, for many of those soldiers had been pardoned by Caesar, and then deserted back to Pompey. For them there would be no second chances. Finally, Caesar's 10th legion on the right managed to push the opposing forces back. Pompey, under the council of Labienus, ordered troops to move from his right to the threatened left flank. Caesar's cavalry on the left saw the move and made a mighty charge that pushed back the Pompeian right wing. The faltering of both wings eventually caused the raw legions in Pompey's center to bolt back toward the town. About 30,000 Pompeians died - most slaughtered in the rout. Gnaeus Pompey died with them, and also Titus Labienus, Caesar's trusted aide who became his bitter opponent. Caesar had won the battle, but later said "he had fought many times for victory, but at Munda he fought for his life."</p><p>With his victory at Munda, Caesar finally brought the civil war to an end. Caesar returned to Rome and became "Dictator for Life." Peace did not last long as Caesar only ruled until March 15, 44 BC when he was assassinated.</p>}

Although Rome defeated Mithridates in the First and Second Mithridatic Wars, he was allowed to maintain his kingdom in Pontus.

Mithridates fled to the court of his son-in-law, King Tigranes the Great of Armenia, who refused a Roman demand to surrender him.

Meanwhile, Tigranes raised a large force of Armenians and allies in Taurus.</p><p>As Tigranes' army approached to lift the siege, Lucullus split his force, leaving enough strengh to maintain the siege and deploying the rest of his army along a deep river to block the advancing Armenians. Tigranes deployed opposite the Romans, confident of an easy victory, but argued with Mithridates about the plan of action. Lucullus led a column out of sight of the Armenian army, crossed at a bend in the river, and gained Tigranes' right flank. Seeing the opportunity, Lucullus personally led the Roman charge down the hill against a force composed of both light horse and cataphracts. Tigranes tried to adjust his battle line but it was too late. The cavalry was either destroyed or driven off and the Armenian baggage train captured. The city of Tigranocerta fell to the Romans, but Tigranes and Mithridates fled with the rest of the army and continued to resist.</p>}

Reputedly the richest man in Rome, Crassus lacked any great military achievement to compare with Caesar's conquest of Gaul and Pompey's many exploits. An ambitious man, Crassus saw the conquest of the Parthian Empire as his opportunity to match or surpass his colleagues in glory. Crassus arrived in Syria with seven legions and 4000 cavarly and marched directly through the desert towards the parthian heartland. Shortly after crossing the Euphrates, his army was surprised near Carrhae by the Parthian general Surena and a cavalry force made up of horse archers and cataphracts. Crassus formed his men into an open square, but Surena made no effort to close, content to harass the Romans with a hail of arrows.</p><p>Crassus and his officers believed they had only to hold out until the horse archers expended the small number of shafts they could carry with them. However, Surena had brought along a camel train with a huge re-supply of arrows. Crassus sent his son Publius forward with the Roman cavalry to pin down the horse archers but the Parthians fell back. Publius rashly pursued too far and Surena annihilated his force. Publius' head was carried back to the Romans upon a spear to taunt his father. This broke the spirit of Crassus and the Roman soldiers, throats cracking with thirst, were overwhelmed. Crassus withdrew with a mere 500 survivors westward when the Parthians retired for the night. During negotiations following the fight, Crassus was treacherously captured. Surena had heard that the Roman commander thirsted for wealth, so he had Crassus executed by pouring molten gold down his throat. most of the legionary eagles were captured by the Parthians, a disgrace that would rankle the Romans for years to come.</p>}

Opposing them were the assassins Marcus Brutus and Gaius Cassius, who sought to re-establish the Republic. The Republicans levied a large army in the east and set up camp near Philippi in Macedonia. With ample supplies, the fortified Republican position between two hills and a marsh seemed impregnable. When Mark Antony and Octavian arrived with their large veteran army, they camped a short distance from the Republicans' fortified position. Beset with supply problems, Antony constructed a causeway through the marsh and only then attacked. Capturing the high ground forced Cassius to weaken his front. Brutus marched out to take Antony in the flank, and Octavian in turn marched forward to engage Brutus' forces. Brutus' Republican legions defeated Octavian's forces and captured his camp. Meanwhile, Cassius lost his camp to Antony's outflanking force. Falsely believing Brutus had also been defeated, Cassius committed suicide.

The Iceni client-king Prasutagus died while the Roman govenor, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was campaigning in what is now northern Wales. In Suetonius' absence, the procurator, Catus Decianus, took advantage of these event to seize lands, recall loans, and generally revoke all the advantages the clients had obtained from Claudius.

The Parthian army was strong in cavalry and horse archers, and at sunrise the cavalry and cataphract camels attempted to close with the Roman line. But, when the Roman light infantry evaded, they strew the ground with caltrops (spiked balls) and the pursuers found themselves in a difficult situation. After several such assaults and night drawing near, both armies retired to their camps. The second day was a repeat of the first day, with skirmishing from morning to night but again no clear advantage to either side. On day three, the Parthian army attempted to use their greater numbers to surround the Romans. The Romans succeeded in extending their line using the light cavalry and light troops to protect their flanks. By the end of the third day, both armies had suffered severely and were exhausted. Under these circumstances, Macrinus opened negotiations with Artabanus and bought peace with some territorial concessions.</p>}

    description{<p>Around 220 AD Ardashir I, a Persian vassal, considered the state of the Parthian Empire. Ardashir knew about dissensions in the Parthian royal house and reasoned that the losses which Artabanus had sustained in his battles with the Romans and against his brother Vologases had weakened Parthian military power. He decided the time was right to declare the independence of Persia. Artabanus did not take any immediate steps to respond, which allowed Ardashir's rebellion to spread. Then Artabanus sent a provincial governor of Khuzestan to deal with the Persian, but Ardashir defeated this expedition. Finally, Artabanus himself led the remnants of the royal Parthian army into Persia. This invasion resulted in three battles. The final and decisive battle took place in the plain of Hormuz, between the Rivers Bebahan and Shuster. The Parthian cavalry army faced a balanced Persian army of cavalry and infantry. Artabanus was slain in the battle and his army completely defeated. With Artabanus' death, the Parthian Arsacid dynasty ended after ruling for 473 years. Ardashir's victory established a new Persian dynasty, the Sassanids, who would rule for another four centuries.</p>}

This led to another succession crisis and civil war. The legions in Germany acclaimed a professional soldier, Maximus Thrax, as the new emperor. Maximus' harsh rule alienated the Senate and populace of Rome. Then in 238 AD, the aged governor of the province of Africa, Gordanius I, was acclaimed co-emperor with his son, Gordanius II, by rebel forces. The Roman Senate quickly switched its allegiance to Gordanius. The father and son hastily raised an army in Africa. Capelianus, the governor of Numidia, remained loyal to Emperor Maximus. He was in command of the only legion in the region at this time, the III Augusta. The two armies met near Carthage with Gordianus II leading his army of untrained troops against Capelianus' veteran Legion III Augusta and other units. During the battle Gordianus II was killed and his army soundly defeated. Gordianus I committed suicide upon learning of his son's death. Maximus benefited only briefly from his lieutenant's victory, as the rebellion of the Roman senate continued. The Praetorian guards assassinated Maximus, and the grandson of Gordanius I was chosed by the Senate as the new emperor. Gordianus III would rule for seven years.</p>}

The most serious threat was posed by the Alemanni, a Germanic tribe that had made frequent incursions into Roman territory. In 271 AD, after Aurelian had moved several of the western legions east to fight the Vandals and Goths, the Alemanni broke through the frontier forces and invaded Italia. The Alemanni horde first sacked the city of Placentia in northern Italia. Emperor Aurelian, who was in Pannonia (near present day Hungary) with an army to control the Vandals, had to move quickly back to Italia. The Alemanni learned of Aurelian's approach and set an ambush for the Roman Emperor. They achieved complete surprise and defeated the Romans.

Seeing that the battle was going badly, Maxentius ordered his army to retreat and seek safety behind Rome's strong walls, but the planned withdrawal degenerated into a rout as the retreating troops bunched up at the Milvian Bridge.

    description{<p>After Cannae, Rome struggled to rebuild its armies, but needed time. In Spain, Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal commanded an army large enough to possibly let Carthage win the war - if it united with Hannibal's victorious veterans. Standing in his way, however, were the legions of two capable (at last) consuls, the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Scipio. Both knew of the tactics used at Cannae, but felt the only way to counter encirclement was to quickly break the Carthaginian center. When the battle commenced, the Roman legions fiercely attacked the Carthaginian center, but, unlike Cannae, there was enough Roman cavalry to hold their flanks. Lacking cavalry superiority (and his brother's tactical genius), Hasdrubal was unable to surround the Romans before they broke through his center. His cavalry joined the retreat, leaving the splendid heavy infantry to its fate. Rome was granted the time it needed to live and fight another day. Eight years later, Hasdrubal finally was able to march to Italy, but lost both his army and his life at the Metaurus.</p>}

    description{<p>Much of Hannibal's "genius" for warfare lay in his ability to take the measure of his opponents' abilities and intentions. His opponent in 217 BC was Roman Consul Gaius Flaminius, a vain and incompetent patrician. Armed with this knowledge, Hannibal set a trap for his opponent by ravaging the countryside to spur Flaminius to action. True to form, Flaminius rushed headlong into pursuit of Hannibal, marching his army through the narrow defile next to Lake Trasimenus where Hannibal's army lay in ambush. Hannibal posted his veteran infantry as a blocking force, hiding his light infantry and cavalry in the hills. As the day of battle dawned, a heavy mist covered the area. Flaminius further aided Hannibal's plans by neglecting to send out scouts. The Roman vanguard stumbled into the Carthaginian blocking force and the battle was joined. Almost immediately, the ambushing Carthaginians descended from the hills and fell on the Roman column before the soldiers had enough time to deploy. Flaminius died early in the fighting; more than half of his army died along with him, either in the desperate fighting or drowning trying to escape. It was noteworthy that the only portion of Flaminius's army to escape intact was the vanguard&mdash;those soldiers fought their way through Hannibal's best infantry to do it. It surely was not through lack of bravery that the Roman army met disaster at Lake Trasimenus.</p>}

After a series of defeates early in the 3rd century BC, the Gauls remained quiet for 50 years. But when the Romans began settling on captured Gallic lands in 232, this roused the barbarians to prepare another invasion. This time, the Cisalpine Gauls were joined by their kinsmen from across the Alps, the fierce Gaesatae under Kings Aneroestes and Concolitanus. in 225 BC, a force of 70,000 Gauls descended on Etruria and overran the country, looting and pillaging. When they reached Clusium, a city only three days' journey from Rome, a Roman army (led by a praetor whose name is lost to history) appeared on their heels, forcing them to turn back and confront it. The two armies camped for the night in close proximity. The Gauls kept their campfires burning but withdrew their infantry, leaving only their cavalry behind. The horsemen had orders to retire when the enemy approached, leading the Romans toward Faesulae, where their infantry would attack from ambush. At daybreak, the Romans, seeing the cavalry alone and thinking the Gauls had taken to flight, followed the cavalry with all speed. On their approach, the Gauls sprang from ambush and attacked them. A stubborn conflict took place, but finally the numbers and courage of the Gauls prevailed. The surviving Romans retreated to a hill, while the Gauls set up a loose blockade. These fugitives would all have been lost but the consul Aemilius Paullus arrived with a relief army that night. The Gallic kings chose to retreat with their booty rather than fight another battle. They broke camp before daybreak and retreated along the seacost through Etruria.</p>}

Regulus and a veteran Roman army landed in Africa, and, though woefully short of cavalry, defeated several Carthaginian forces. Desperate, the Carthaginians turned to an otherwise unemployed Greek general named Xanthippus, who knew how to train and command an army, as well as how to put the Carthaginian advantages in mounted troops into use. The Carthaginian army marched into Bagradas Valley and Regulus, confident of yet another victory, offered battle. It was to prove a costly mistake for him. The Carthaginian cavalry and elephants routed the Roman cavalry and then turned on the flanks and rear of the Roman army, now fully engaged with the Carthaginian infantry. The Roman army disintegrated. Those who survived told of the horror of being overrun by elephants and cavalry. This Carthaginian victory prolonged the war. It took several years before any Roman army would stand and fight against elephants. The larger lesson - proper employment of a combined arms army over a largely infantry army resulting in victory - was lost on the Romans. They had to re-learn it at the Trebbia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannae.</p>}

Pyrrhus decided to return to Italy. Years of attrition and a naval defeat on his way back to Italy had greatly weakened his army. However, upon his return, his reputation brought thousands of new recruits out to join him. With 20,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and 20 elephants, Pyrrhus once again marched on Rome. Consul Manius Curius Dentatus gathered his army of about 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse and set up camp near Beneventum to await the Epirote army. Pyrrhus decided on a surprise night attack, but some of his detachments got lost. It was morning before he could organize his scattered forces near the Roman camp. Dentatus led his forces out and drove back Pyrrhus' vanguard. As the Roman attack continued it was in turn driven back by Pyrrhus' skillful use of his elephants. However, a second Roman assault stampeded the elephants into the Pyrrhus' phalanx. Dentatus struck while the phalanx was disordered and broke it, winning the battle. Pyrrhus withdrew from the field with what was left of his army and returned to Epirus, never to return to Italy. Beneventum was the final pivotal battle in the Roman Republic's bid for control of the entire Italian peninsula, and the first great victory of the legion over the phalanx.</p>}

The opposing Successor armies in Asia - one commanded by Antigonus, the other by Eumenes - met in battle at Paraitacene in 371 BC. Antigonus was by now the most powerful of the Diadochi, controlling most of Anatolia and the eastern satrapies. Eumenes had the backing of Alexander's heirs and a large war chest, though the fact that he was a Greek and not a Macedonian was a major handicap. Antigonus fielded 28,000 infantry and 11,000 horse. Eumenes' force of 35,000 foot and 6,000 horse included the veteran Silver Shields, who had fought with distinction in all of Alexander's campaigns. The battle opened with Antigonus' light horse attacking Eumenes' right. This attack was wrecked by Eumenes' heavy cavalry. Meanwhile in the center, the Silver Shields drove back Antigonus' phalanx. Antigonus' army was on the ropes when he pulled off a stroke that evened the score. He charged through a gap and was successful in routing Eumenes' left flank. Both sides at this point were exhausted and returned to their camps. Antigonus claimed victory, but realistically the battle was a draw and a final resolution would not be reached until the armies met at Gabiene, a year later.</p>}

Learning that a large force was moving to reinforce Porus, Alexander decisively divided his army and secretly crossed up-river with the majority of the Macedonian troops, leaving a large detachment in place to deceive the Indians. Upon receiving the startling news that Alexander had crossed the Hydaspes, Porus hurriedly turned his army to meet him in battle. Porus sent his chariots forward but these were quickly destroyed. Alexander then sent his cavalry to attack Porus' rigt wing and gained the flank of the Indian army, while his heavy infantry advanced to attack the elephants and bowmen. The elephants charged the phalanx and did great execution among the elite Macedonian infantry. Only the timely intervention of the light troops prevented a greater loss. Porus, wounded six times, was captured and the remainder of his army routed. Porus so impressed Alexander with his bravery that he was allowed to retain his kingdom as a Macedonian vassal.

In a two-year campaign he captured Type and Gaza and conquered Egypt. In 331, Alexander marched into Mesopotamia, intent on attacking Babylon. Darius had raised another army, strong in cavalry but lacking in good infantry. The two armies met on the plain of Gaugamela. Darius posted cavalry on the right and the left and occupied the center with his Greek mercenaries, guard cavalry, elephants, and chariots. Alexander placed the Thessalian horse on the left, gave Craterus the phalanx in the center, and placed himself in person with the Companions on the right. The Persian line extended well beyond both flanks of the Macedonian formation. To counter, Alexander moved diagonally as he advanced, refusing his left. Darius ordered his mounted troops forward. The Macedonian right managed to hold their attackers just long enough for Alexander to charge with his Companions and heavy infantry straight for Darius. As he has at Issus, Darius turned and fled the field but the battle was not yet over. The Macedonian left was still hard pressed by the Persian cavalry. Alexander wheeled about and charged with the Companions into the Persian cavalry, forcing them back. Soon the entire Persian army was in retreat. Gaugamela is one of the truly decisive battles of history and marked the beginning of Alexander's great empire. This battle is also considered the classic example of penetration tactics.</p>}

The Sacred Band formed part of a large army under Hasdrubal, advancing eastward to subjugate Sicily. Opposing him with a much smaller army was the able tactician Timoleon. Ever aggressive, Timoleon anxiously awaited an opportunity to strike the Carthaginians a hard blow on his terms. He got that chance when, on a foggy morning, Hasdrubal carelessly ordered his army to cross the Crimissos River without bothering to send out scouts (who would have reported that Timoleon's army was arrayed on the bluffs just beyond the river). Waiting until about half of the Carthaginian army had crossed, Timoleon unleashed his excellent heavy infantry phalanx against the surprised Carthaginians. Most who survived fled, but the Sacred Band stood their ground and were annihilated by superior numbers, (aided by a sudden rainstorm that slowed Carthaginian reinforcements crossing the river). Seeing the disaster unfolding across the river, the remainder of Hasdrubal's army broke and fled. The loss of so many citizen soldiers had a horrific effect on Carthage. The Sacred Band was reformed, but only once was it ever dispatched from Africa again, and then only for a very short campaign.

A meeting was called in Athens, and a Greek fleet of 110 ships set sail from Delos under the command of the Spartan King Leotychides. The Persians, no longer confident after the crushing naval defeat at Salamis, dismissed their Phoenician naval contingent and moved the remainder of the fleet to Mycale, where they joined forces with the army that Xerxes had led back to Asia. The Greeks expected a naval battle, but when they approached the Persian camp, they found the ships beached and the Persian army in combat formation. The Athenians, under Xanthippus, landed on the beach and during their advance found a herald's scepter. Believing it was a divine sign that the Greeks had been victorious at Plataea, they charged forward without the Spartans. The Spartans had landed at another site and were still marching around the flank through the hills. The Persians repelled the Athenian assaults for a time, but eventually the Athenians manage to burst through to the Persian camp. The battle continued with no side certain of victory until the arrival of the Spartans, and the desertion of the Ionian Greeks, who joined in the attack on the Persians. The Persian army turned and fled to the mountains. Mycale ended the Persian Wars and the Greek cities in Asia were accepted into a league with Athens.</p>}

He forced the Phocians to accept terms, but while he was in Doris an Athenian Fleet moved into position to block his return across the Corinthian Gulf. Athens, then sent out an army to meet the Spartans, and the two forces meet outside Tanagra. The Athenians brought a large contingent of Hoplites supplemented by a number of allies. The total number given by Thucydides is 14,000 plus a small contingent of Thessalian cavalry. The allied Spartan army consisted of 1,500 Spartans and 10,000 allied soldiers. According to Thucydides, the Thessalian cavalry joined the Spartan side during the battle, and the Spartans and their allies wore down and broke the Athenians. Both armies suffered heavy losses, but the Spartans won the battle and opened the way back home. This was the first major land battle of the war and began a pattern of Spartan dominance on land.</p>}

He convinced the Ambraciots to invade Amphilokia, and their forces joined him at Olpae. in response, the Amphilokians called on their allies and the nearby Athenian fleet under Demosthenes. Demosthenes only had a small force, but was chosen to be the strategos, or commander, of the allied army. Eurylochus deployed with his Peleponnesians on the left and Ambraciots on the right. Demosthenes countered with his Messenians on the right, Arcanians in the center and Amphilokians on the left. Seeing that his army was badly outnumbered, Demosthenes extended his left wing with light troops and posted a picket force in hiding to ambush the Spartan right. When the lines clashed, Demosthenes sprung his ambush and routed the Peleponnesians, killing Eurylochus. Meanwhile, the Ambraciots also routed the Athenian left, but Demosthenes was able to keep his victorious wing in good order and attacked these troops, completing his victory.

The Athenians used a double agent to trick the Syracusan army into marching to Catana, and when they took the bait, landed unopposed south of the Anapus River. There they took up a strong defensive position. When the Syracusans returned and found the Athenians waiting, they made camp for the night, intending to fight the next day.

The Athenians used the river to guard their left as they advanced, and placed their light troops on the wings to fight off the Syracusan cavalry. Despite the greater depth of the Syracusan phalanx, the superior discipline and experience of the Athenians carried the day. However, they could not undertake an aggressive pursuit and score a decisive victory due to the lack of cavalry. It was a tactical victory without a strategic result.

When he reached Leuctra he found the Thegan army barred his way. The Spartans deployed in a long line with their allies on the left. Greek commanders traditionally placed their best troops on the right, and this wing usually led the attack. The brilliant Theban commander, Epaminondas, devised an innovative plan to mass his best men on the left in a 50-man deep phalanx. He intended to use this mass to break through the famed Spartan phalanx. Both sides sent their cavalry out and the Spartan horse were quickly defeated. Seeing his cavalry fail, Cleombrotos ordered his infantry to advance. Simultaneously, Epaminondas' massed left advanced against the Spartan right, while the rest of his army was ordered to hold back, in an oblique order. The Spartans were attempting to change formation to deal with the situation when the Sacred Band charged and hit them in mid-maneuver.

    description{<p>Sparta had stood on the sidelines while Athens and Thebes battled Macedon at Chaeronea. As the Macedonian army plunged ever deeper into Asia, King Agis III sensed an opportunity to regain the hegemony of Greece for Sparta. Agis began secret negotiations with the Persians and obtained funding for a rebellion. in 331 the Macedonian army was stretched thin - Alexander was advancing into Mesopotamia, Antigonus was fighting an insurrection in Phrygia and Antipater, the strategos of Europe, was quelling a revolt in Thrace. Agis chose this opportune moment to attack Megalopolis, but Antipater quickly subdued the Thracians and headed south to face the upstart Spartans. Agis commanded 20,000 foot and 2,000 cavalry while Antipater had about 30,000 men. Agis's numerical inferiority convinced Agis to lift the siege and maneuver to a constricted battlefield. When the two armies clashed, Agis's Spartans broke through the Macedonian line at first, and his mercenaries drove back their opponents. Antipater brought up his reserves and stabilized his line. There was fierce fighting around the Spartan king and when Agis was slain, his army collapsed. The power of Sparta was broken for a century, and Alexander's home base was secure as he headed further east.</p>}

The Carthaginians under Himilco have besieged Akragas, a city allied with Syracuse, prompting Daphnaeus and his army to march to its aid. The Carthaginians split their army into an observation force in front of Akragas, and a blocking force sent to oppose Daphnaeus. The Carthaginian army was almost totally mercenary, while Daphnaeus's contained veteran heavy infantry that proved invincible when committed to the battle. The survivor's of Himilco's badly beaten army fled to the coastal fort sheltering Mago's observation force. There was no pursuit and no further battle. Daphnaeus's force was spent, and the forces in Akragas did not sortie. Before another assault could be make on the Carthaginians, their navy managed to interdict the Greek supply line, forcing Daphnaeus to withdraw. Akragas fell eight months later without a fight.</p>}

They formed the Sacred Band, a force of about 2,500 excellently trained Carthaginians, as good or better than the best the Greeks or Syracusans could field. They formed a part of a large army under Hasdrubal, advancing eastward to subjugate Sicily. Opposing him with a mch smaller army was the able tactician Timoleon. Ever aggressive, Timoleon anxiously awaited an opportunity to strike the Carthaginians a hard blow on his terms. He got that chance when, on a goffy morning, Hasdrubal carelessly ordered his army to cross the Crimissos River without bothering to send out scouts (who would have reported that Timoleon's army was arrayed on the bluffs just beyond the river). Waiting until about half of the Carthaginian army had crossed, Timoleon unleashed his excellent heavy infantry phalanx against the surprised Carthaginians. Most who survived fled, but the Sacred Band stood their ground and were annihilated by superior numbers, (aided by a sudden rainstorm that slowed Carthaginian reinforcements crossing the river). Seeing the disaster unfolding across the river, the remainder of Hasdrubal's army broke and fled. The loss of so many citizen soldiers had a horrific effect on Carthage. The Sacred Band was reformed, but only once was it ever dispatched from Africa again, and then only for a very short campaign.</p>}

Regulus and a veteran Roman army have landed in Africa, and though woefully short of cavalry, have defeated several Carthaginian forces. Desperate, the Carthaginians turned to an otherwise unemployed Greek general, Xanthippus. While not on a par with Alexander the Great, Xanthippus at least knew how to train and command an army, and that was enough. The Carthaginian army marched into the Bagradas Valley, and Regulus, confident of yet another victory, offered battle. It was to prove a costly mistake for him. The Carthaginian cavalry and elephants routed the Roman cavalry, and then turned on the flanks and rear of the Roman army, now fully engaged with the Carthaginian infantry. The Roman army disintegrated. Those who survived told of the horror of being overrun by elephants and cavalry. This Carthaginian victory prolonged the war. It took several years before any Roman army would stand and fight against elephants. The larger lesson— proper employment of a combined arms army over a largely infantry army resulting in victory—was lost on the Romans. They had to re-learn it at the Trebbia, Lake Trasimenus and Cannae.</p>}

Hannibal had prepared the first of many traps for unwary Romans - he had placed his brother Mago and a picked force of cavalry and infantry out of sight in a ravine. The Romans did not discover them as they passed by. Despite their cold and hunger, the Roman infantry was doing well against Hannibal's main line. Then twin disaster struck. Mago's detachment emerged from hiding and struck the Romans from behind, and the weather turned markedly colder. Assailed from two sides, and now literally freezing to death, the Romans broke.

His opponent in 217 BC was Roman Consul Gaius Flaminius, a vain and incompetent patrician. Armed with this knowledge, Hannibal determined to set a trap for his opponent by ravaging the countryside to spur Flaminius to action. True to form, Flaminius rushed headlong into pursuit of Hannibal, marching his army through the narrow defile next to Lake Trasimenus where Hannibal’s army lay in wait. Hannibal posted his veteran infantry as a blocking force, hiding his light infantry and cavalry in the hills. As the day of battle dawned, a heavy mist covered the area – Flaminius further aided Hannibal’s plans by neglecting to send out scouts. The Roman vanguard stumbled into the Carthaginian blocking force, and the battle was joined. Almost immediately the ambushing Carthaginians descended from the hills and fell on the Roman column before the soldiers had enough time to deploy. Flaminius died early in the fighting; more than half of his army died along with him, either in the desperate fighting or drowning trying to escape. It was noteworthy that the only portion of Flaminius’s army to escape intact was the vanguard – those soldiers fought their way through Hannibal’s best infantry to do it. It surely was not through lack of bravery that the Roman army met disaster at Lake Trasimenus.</p>}

Undeterred, Varrus simply packed his legions one behind the other into the constricted area and launched the mass headlong at the Carthaginian center. They advanced into yet another trap. Hannibal had deployed his excellent cavalry and heavy infantry on the wings, leaving his medium infantry and Celt levies in the center. The Roman advance did indeed push the Carthaginian center back and inflict losses, but in the meantime the Carthaginian cavalry had routed the Roman cavalry on both flanks and closed in on the rear of the Roman army while the heavy infantry advanced on both Roman flanks. Surrounded and unable to maneuver, the Roman soldiers were slaughtered by the thousands, and the army was destroyed. Cannae was Rome’s greatest military defeat, and Hannibal’s greatest victory.</p>}

Standing in his way, however, were the legions of two capable (at last) consuls, the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Scipio. Both knew of Cannae, but felt the only way to prevent encirclement was to quickly break the Carthaginian center. When the battle commenced, the Roman legions fiercely attacked the Carthaginian center, but , unlike Cannae, there was enough Roman cavalry to hold their flanks. Lacking cavalry superiority (and his brother’s tactical genius), Hasdrubal was unable to surround the Romans before they broke through his center. His cavalry joined the retreat, leaving the splendid heavy infantry to its fate. Rome was granted the time it needed to live and fight another day. Eight years later, Hasdrubal finally was able to march to Italy, but lost both his army and his life at the Metaurus. </p>}

Gracchus issued a decree to his men before the battle - freedom to any soldier bringing back a Carthaginian head. The Roman attack started well, but as soon as Carthaginians began to fall, scores of Gracchus's troops broke ranks to decapitate corpses. Faced with a disintegrating army, Gracchus corrected his error by amending his decree to "win the battle and secure your freedom." The slave soldiers quickly reformed and swept all before them.

He first put this training to use at Baecula where Hasdrubal, Hannibal’s brother, had drawn up his army in a strong hilltop defensive position – light troops to the front; heavy troops in reserve in the camps. Traditional Roman practice would have sent the legions straight ahead at the hills. Scipio, however, put his legionary infantry on each flank and advanced his light troops in the center. As the battle was joined, Hasdrubal discovered he was being outmaneuvered. If he advanced his heavies to support the light troops, the Roman legions on each flank would encircle his entire army. Knowing his army was urgently needed in Italy, Hasdrubal withdrew his heavies and left the light troops to either escape or die in place.

Taking a daring risk, Nero leaves part of his army to convince Hannibal that nothing is happening. Making an epic forced march, in six days he joins the Romans opposing Hasdrubal, giving them an edge in numbers. Hasdrubal tries to retreat, but the flooded Metaurus blocks his way.

Forced to give battle or give up Spain, their most valuable province, the Carthaginian armies united and took up position on the plains outside of Ilipa. For three days both armies deployed with their heavy infantry in the center and light troops on each wing. Scipio assumed that the Carthaginians would continue to deploy in this manner and he was correct. On the fourth day he sent light troops and cavalry to attack the Carthaginian camp. Hasdrubal responded by deploying his army with the heavies in the center. Only after the Roman screen retired did he see the Romans deployed with legionary infantry on both wings and Spanish troops plus lights in the center. The Roman cavalry and legions quickly deployed and began destroying both Carthaginian light wings. Hasdrubal was unable to send any heavies to support the wings because he would open holes in the center that the Romans would pour through to destroy his army. Both Carthaginian wings disintegrated and the excellent heavy troops in the center were facing destruction until a providential thunderstorm allowed some of them to escape. The combined Carthaginian army was destroyed as a fighting force, and Spain now belonged to Rome.

Once the Romans had retired north of the Ebro River for the winter, the Carthaginians struck back in late autumn (215) and besieged Iliturgi, a Roman garrisoned city. Each Punic commander set up a separate camp around the city. The citizens of Iliturgi and their Roman garrison soon suffered from hunger, as they had been caught unprepared. Gnaeus and Publius Scipio marched to the scene with two legions, about 18,000 troops, to lift the siege. Upon arriving, the Scipios decided to assault Hasdrubal's camp first, as it was the largest and the key to breaking the siege.

Ultimately, the Romans emerged victorious, overrunning the camp and breaking the siege. However, the casualties were probably about equal on both sides. Since Rome was hard-pressed by Hannibal in Italy, the Carthaginians could more easily replace their losses, and benefited from such battles of attrition.

Although still heavily outnumbered, Hanno decided to occupy a strong position on high ground rather than retreat to join Hasdrubal. Gnaeus Scipio did not hesitate and charged his army up the heights in a frontal assault. The fighting was brutal, but the outnumbered Carthaginians were eventually driven off the heights in flight. Reportedly, Carthage lost 6,000 killed and 2,000 captured, including both Hanno and Indibilis. Despite suffering heavy losses, the Romans had the victory. The Romans had established a foothold in Spain. Indibilis was later released, an act of clemency Gnaeus Scipio soon came to regret. Publius finally arrived a year later, bringing a third legion of 8,000 reinforcements. Each of the Scipio brothers could now command his own army in Spain.</p>}

    description{<p>Sardinia had been a Carthaginian province for centuries until the turmoil of the Truceless War (241-238) allowed Rome to opportunistically seize the island. This incident fed the hatred of Hamilcar Barca and his sons for Rome. While Hannibal was crossing the Alps to invade Italy, the agent Hanno slipped onto the island to foment a tribal rebellion. After Hannibal's great victory at Cannae, Hanno instigated an island-wide uprising under King Hampsicora and sent messengers to Carthage for support to capture the weakly garrisoned island. An expedition under Hasdrubal the Bald was delayed by a storm. While Hasdrubal was re-fitting his fleet, the Romans scraped up a reinforcing legion under the septuagenarian noble Titus Manlius Torquatus, who was already on the island when Hasdrubal finally arrived. The two armies met near Caralis. Hasdrubal, with about 20,000 men and 20 elephants, posted his Sards on one wing and his African and Balearic expeditionary forces on the other. Torquatus grounded his fleet and pressed his sailors into service to swell his ranks to 22,000 foot and 1200 horse. The fighting was fierce and prolonged. Eventually, the Sard wing collapsed and Hanno's African wing, which had been fighting well, was taken in the flank and also routed. Reports said 12,000 Sardinians and Carthaginians were slain and about 3700 men, including Hasdrubal and Hanno, were taken captive. Hampsicora commited suicide when he learned that his son Hostus had been killed in the fighting. Sardinia would remain in Roman hands.</p>}

Marcellus succeeded in taking Syracuse but the Sicilian campaign was not yet over. Epicydes rallied the remnants of the Carthaginian and Greek armies at Agrigentum and Hanno arrived from Africa with a new army, including 3000 Numidian cavalry. Hannibal also sent one of his crack cavalry commanders, the Liby-Phoenician Muttines, who was soon dashing all over Sicily with the Numidians. The three Punic commanders built their army up to 20,000 foot and 3500 horse, but Hanno, jealous of Muttines' success, ordered him to not march with the army. Marcellus marched against them with about 24,000 foot and 2000 horse. At this point, 10 Numidian deserters rode to the Roman camp and informed Marcellus that their countrymen were furious at the insult to Muttines and intended to take no part in the battle. Hoping the news was true, but expecting a trap, Marcellus led his legions out to face the Punic army. As the Libyan and Greek infantry advanced into the fray, it became apparent that the Numidians were holding back. Marcellus ordered the Roman horse to turn the exposed Punic flank. When the Numidians did not respond, the Punic infantry became demoralized and broke. Marcellus had the victory.</p>}

Scipio had 25,000 foot but brought only a little over 2,000 horsemen across the sea. Six hundred were Romans and the remainder allied Italian horsemen. While in Sicily, Scipio had summoned 300 noble cavalry from the Greek cities. Cleverly, he offered them the option of declining to join his army if they turned over their fine mounts, arms and armor and in this way Scipio re-equipped 300 of his elite Italian extraordinaire. The Numidian prince Masinissa joined Scipio, but with only 200 horsemen.</p><p>Even though Scipio was outnumbered, he decided to lure Hanno into an ambush. He posted his Roman and Italian horse behind a ridge overlooked by a watchtower built by the earlier Greek invader, Agathocles. Masinissa demonstrated in front of the Punic camp, and lured them out.

Hanno organized his army with the mercenaries in the van, his elephants in a second line and his African levies in a third. As the armies clashed the mercenaries fought fiercely at first, but eventually buckled. As they routed into the line of elephants, all hell broke loose. The elephants were caught up in the pandemonium,and began to rampage in all directions. The third Carthaginian line was thrown into confusion, but rallied to resist the advancing legions. After more hard fighting, the Punic army broke. The largest battle of the First Punic War had ended in a decisive Roman victory, but ironically Hannibal's army was able to escape.

Many more Roman allies would have defected if Publius Scipio had not hurried south with one legion, about 10,000 men. Scipio camped near Castrum Album, famous as the site of Hamilcar Barca's death fourteen years earlier. Hasdrubal, Mago and Hannibal infiltrated the surrounding area undetected. They brought only fast-moving light infantry and mounted troops. When Publius Scipio advanced from Castrum Album towards his brother Gnaeus' camp, he was beset by Punic skirmishers and Numidian horsemen. The light Carthaginian forces showered the slow moving Roman column with javelins, sling-stones and arrows. Whenever the Romans charged, their opponents melted away. Publius' command was in danger of annihilation, and he just barely cut his way through to the safety of his brother's camp. Over 2,000 Romans were left dead along the route of his march, and many of the survivors were wounded. It was a clear Carthaginian victory.

The Battle of Britain was raging, and Italy had assembled a large army in North Africa to invade Egypt, capture the canal, and turn the British out of the Mediterranean. Britain could not spare forces for Egypt, and the heavily outnumbered British covering force harassed the invaders but fell back under superior pressure. The Italian Army, under Graziani, advanced to Sidi Barrani, and there stopped and fortified. The Italian buildup was slow, and in November the British hazarded a spoiling raid to disrupt the Italian buildup. Graziani's army disintegrated under the shock: half was captured outright and half routed back to the Libyan coastal fortresses. The much more mobile British isolated the two fortresses of Bardia and Tobruk and after a delay, stormed them and captured most of the rest of Graziani's force. The final remnants of the Italians attempted to withdraw to Agheila, but were cut off at Beda Fomm by a daring British move, and annihilated. An entire Italian army of over 150,000 had been wiped out by a British force of 30,000 in less than 4 months. Though the way was clear for a British advance to Tripoli, Churchill instead stripped the front of forces for a pet project: the disastrous expedition to Greece. The stage was set for Rommel.</p><p>The Italians begin with an advantage in strength and supply, but greatly inferior mobility. The British have an infantry shortage, but gain an armor and supply advantage late in the game.

But if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.”</p><p>So said Jonathan Parker on Lexington Green, April 19, 1775. Minutes later, the “shot heard ‘round the world” shattered the morning stillness and sparked a clash between British soldiers and Parker’s Lexington militiamen. Before the day ended, close to three hundred British soldiers and one hundred American colonists were dead or wounded. The ensuing civil war lasted eight years and engulfed most of the eastern half of North America. To crush the American rebels, the British government deployed the largest military force they had yet sent overseas. The American colonists, divided amongst themselves, fought each other, British regulars, German mercenaries, and Indian warriors in a brutal war. Ultimately, George Washington’s embattled Continental Army and the loosely organized local militia forces, with essential help from the French army and navy, prevailed over the most powerful empire of the age. Playing this game will help you understand why this unlikely outcome became possible.</p>}

Led by Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson, a smaller Confederate army with audacious marching and fighting, paralyzed and defeated three enveloping Union armies. Military students worldwide study Jackson's strategy and tactics to this day.</p><p>The CSA player has the advantage of central position, but must use it aggressively to prevent the Union armies from combining against him. The USA player has a clear advantage in numbers, but must cope with a command system that penalizes the wide separation of his three forces.</p><p>The Valley Campaign is a difficult one to simulate historically. USA commander Banks believed by mid-April that Jackson had left the Valley for Richmond, and reported this to Washington. On May 1st, Lincoln ordered Shields division transferred from Banks to McDowell's corps at Fredericksburg. However, not until May 12th, (Turn 3) did Shields actually leave New Market for Fredericksburg via Luray, Front Royal, and Manassas Gap. Ewell's CSA division at Standardsville could easily have intercepted Shields on that march, but did not. Shields actual withdrawal begins four days after Jackson has defeated Fremont's advance brigades at McDowell, and has then pursued them as far as Franklin. Clearly, Banks and Shields had no idea Jackson has won this battle, partly because General Fremont reported it by telegram as a minor skirmish and tactical retreat.

  description{<p>Shiloh was an important American Civil War battle fought in April 1862. A surprise Confederate attack, led by Albert Sydney Johnston, nearly swept encamped Union defenders into the Tennessee River. The next day, a reinforced Union army counter-attacked and drove the CSA line back in confusion and retreat. A CSA victory might have ruined the career of General Ulysses S. Grant. Instead, the battle ended with a Union victory, the death of Johnston, and the eventual demise of Confederate hopes in the West. Days 1 and 2 can be played separately or together.</p><p>Movement and combat are resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar.

After five years of German rearmament and French political and military confusion, the French army is no match for the Germans even with significant British help.</p><p>As defeat approaches (Paris about to be lost or surrounded), France should consider offering Armistice. Axis acceptance conserves Axis resources but preserves a French empire, leaving the Allies a Vichy-defended “soft spot” for later re-entry into French North Africa.

A dicey proposition, Sea Lion can win the war, or prove a costly failure (even while scaring the daylights out of the Allies).</p><p>Axis refusal of Armistice often leads to an intensive Mediterranean campaign, with the Allies threatening Libya from east and west. Successful evacuation of French forces can prove a great boost to Allied capabilities.</p><p>Axis conquest of Malta or Gibraltar will allow a greatly expanded Axis presence in North Africa, but taking either fortress requires a major Axis effort.  A Gibraltar campaign presupposes the belligerence or defeat of Spain. In the latter case, the Allies should be sure to secure Tangier, facilitating the defense of the fortress. Malta is more vulnerable, being hard to reinforce or supply if Italy is belligerent, but the Axis window of opportunity is tight, with Axis TF airpower ending in winter.</p><p>During the German attack on France, there is a great temptation to Mobilize the Soviets and attack Rumania to deprive Germany of oil. But even if Mobilization is obtained, success in Rumania is iffy.

In the early 1930s Spain was wracked with political upheaval through a series of bitter, closely fought elections between leftist and rightist multi-party coalitions with nearly equal popular support.</p><p>The Popular Front, a loose coalition of landless peasants, labor activists, liberals, socialists, anarchists, Communists, and Catalonian and Basque nationalists, formed the government after a narrow election victory in Feb 1936. On the right were the army, wealthy landowners, the Church, Royalists, and the proto-fascist Falange.</p><p>An exchange of assassinations shook the country, prompting Generals Franco and Mola to raise an army revolt in July 1936. Some risings were suppressed by loyalists (notably in Barcelona and Madrid) and a bloody tradition of execution of “traitors” began on both sides, the Nationalists executing 500,000 of its opponents versus 20,000 by the Republicans.</p><p>The war was fought with a terrible out- pouring of passion, valor, and hostility on both sides. Portugal, Germany, and Italy openly aided Franco, while Russia sent help to the Republic, France vacillated and Britain stood aloof. Motivation was not lacking on either side, just armaments. While the Republican government could never fully arm its numerous volunteers, Germany and Italy saw to it that Franco’s army was well endowed.</p><p>The Nationalists advanced on Madrid, spear-headed by the Spanish Legion (which Franco commanded in the ‘20s) and the largely Moorish Army of Africa. The capital was saved by a stubborn defense keyed by the 11th-hour arrival of the first International Brigades.</p><p>The struggle continued for 3 long years, ending in the slow strangulation of Republican Spain by an international arms blockade, while Franco continued to receive German and Italian arms covertly via Portugal.</p>}

  description{<p>Borodino was fought between the Army of Imperial Russia and Napoléon's Grand Armée on September 7, 1812. The battle ended with a French victory, but strategic defeat. Losses were terrible on both sides, but the Russians could replace theirs. One week after the battle Napoléon occupied an undefended Moscow, hoping to impose a peace, but after four weeks was forced to retreat home with calamitous results.</p><p>The historical battle involved wave after wave of frontal attacks by both sides, focusing on the Russian redoubts. However, the game will show all the options available to Napoléon and Kutuzov, including some not attempted historically. The French player has several possible lines of attack and the Russian player must try to anticipate and counter them all. The tactical interaction of Napoléonic infantry, cavalry and artillery is also emphasized, including cavalry charges and squares. This makes for exciting and tense gaming.</p><p>Movement and combat are resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Shiloh. Players activate leaders to command divisions of the same corps. Game time is 3-4 hours.</p>}

  description{<p>World War 2: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war: from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And, unlike many of those games, World War 2: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his multi-award-winning World War One strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War 2: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.</p><p>As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.</p><p>World War 2: Barbarossa to Berlin covers four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. It is June 22, 1941: will World War II end in German triumph in Operation Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin? As the world holds it breath, the decisions are all yours.</p>}

  description{<p>In Thirty Years War, one player takes the role of the Catholic (Imperial) side, while his opponent is, for lack of a better word, the Protestant player (though the nature of each side’s alliances will constantly change, regardless of religious persuasions). Players manipulate historical leaders, combat units and events through the use of strategy cards in an effort to win control of territory, thereby swinging the Catholic Victory Point total in a direction that will bring them victory. Rules herein provide for a Campaign Game and three shorter scenarios corresponding to the three phases of the war (the early Bohemian phase, the Danish and Swedish interventions, and the final phase of Franco-Spanish intervention).</p>}

With the Swedish army reduced to a desperate, mutinous remnant, and the spectre of a Habsburg Germany looming, Cardinal Richelieu in 1635 entered France into the war on the Protestant side. Thirteen more years of war hung in the future until French and resurgent Swedish armies pushed Emperor Ferdinand III into accepting defeat.</p>}

Late in the year the needed reinforcements arrived and Guebriant moved into action, striking at Rottweil. The Marshal was killed, however, in the storming of the town. The French encamped at Tuttlingen to regroup and reorganize. General Jean de Werth led the Bavarians in what was intended as a raid, catching the French completely by surprise. Capitalizing on the situation, de Werth brought in everything they had and the French were shattered.</p><p>The Armée de Allemagne was then handed over to Turenne. The core of this army was the Weimarians, the German army built by Bernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. Weimar had brought the force into French service in 1635 and led them masterfully until his death. The Weimarians had suffered heavy losses, especially in infantry, at Tuttlingen. The Weimarian officers were divided into two factions, one Pro-French and one Pro-German. The commander of the corps, von Rosen, was the head of the Pro-Germans. The Pro-Germans chaffed against French control and saw French service as a necessary evil to guarantee German independence from the Habsburgs. The Pro-French argued to “not look a gift horse in the mouth” and serve no differently than any other mercenaries.</p>}

    description{<p>Brand-new battleship Tirpitz steamed to Trondheim in January 1942, followed by Admiral Scheer a month later. As air reconnaissance improved with the lengthening hours of daylight, the Germans were determined to put this reinforced surface force to use. Tirpitz and four destroyers sortied to intercept PQ-12 on 6 March and were sighted by a patrolling British submarine. Though already at sea, Adm. Tovey feared an Atlantic breakout and kept his Home Fleet too far west to intercept the German force before it reached the vicinity of the convoy. Fortunately for the Allies, snow and fog shielded both PQ-12 and homebound QP-8 from the Germans, who found and sank only the straggling freighter Ijora from the latter before turning back to Norway. Cued by Ultra, however, Albacore torpedo bombers from HMS Victorious were able to attack Tirpitz in the approaches to Narvik. Although Capt. Topp skillfully evaded all the weapons dropped, a concerned Hitler placed further restrictions on future empoyment of his heavy ships.</p>}

Within a week, severe gales had dispersed the merchantmen, making them highly vulnerable before their questing escorts relocated them; Ju88 bombers sank two. German heavy ships were immobilized by lack of fuel, but three destroyers juined the hunt. Z26 sank the straggling SS Bateau, but was badly damaged by Trinidad and later sunk by Eclipse. In the process, Trinidad was hit by one of her own rogue torpedoes, and barely limped into Murmansk.

Destroyers Paul Jacobi and Z25, both due for refit and the latter damaged while attacking PQ-15, were included. Coincidentally, Trinidad had just completed her own temporary repairs (See Scenario PQ-13), and sailed from the Kola Inlet for the United States on 13 May.

    description{<p>The 35 merchantmen, one naval oiler, and three rescue ships of PQ-17 left Reykjavik on 27 June 1942 in foggy conditions. One freighter ran aground, a second suffered damage from drift ice, and both were left behind as the convoy exited the Denmark Strait and headed for Arkhangelks. They were to prove the lucky ones.</p><p>At first this was not apparent, as the convoy remained unlocated by the Germans until two U-boats and a Fw200 Kondor of KG40 spotted it near Jan Mayen on the afternoon of 1 July. The next day, the convoy passed its unscathed westbound counterpart QP-13, and thwarted attacks by U456 and He115 torpedo bombers of K&uuml;FlGr 406 without loss. Fog and active escorts again shielded PQ-17 on 3 July, but the weather finally cleared enough at Trondheim that afternoon for RAF reconnaissance to confirm Tirpitz and her consorts had deployed. Operation R&ouml;sselsprung ('Knight's Move') had actually gotten underway the day before, when the squadrons at both Trondheim and Narvik sortied to rendezvous and fuel at their advanced base at Alta. Unknown to the British, however, both forces had run afoul of the treacherous Norwegian shoals, as L&uuml;tzow ran aground while leaving Ofotfjord, and destroyers Theodor Riedel, Hans Lody, and Karl Galster struck uncharted rocks entering Altafjord.</p><p>Not until the early morning of 4 July did the Germans score their first success, when a lone He115 of K&uuml;FlGr 906 dove through a holw in the low overcast surprise the convoy and torpedo SS Christopher Newport, which was abandoned and subsequently sunk by U457. Further desultory attacks during the day were driven off until a more determined evening strike by KG26's He111 torpedo bombers sank two freighters and damaged a tanker. Morale in the convoy remained high, even though the cruiser Covering Force was due to withdraw shortly as the convoy passed east of Bear Island. Then all this changed abruptly, as three signals in the space of half an hour culminated with the ominous order at 2136: "Convoy is to scatter."</p><p>Lack of further intelligence had convinced the First Sea Lord, Adm. Dudley Pound, that Tirpitz and her consorts were at sea and about to fall upon the convoy -- what he directed in his German counterpart's place. Fearing losses to air and submarine attack, the capital ships of the Home Fleet were too far to the west to intervene. Pound saw no choice but to order the cruisers to join the Home Fleet while the convoy ships sought maximum dispersal to avoid their loss en masse (as had happened on a smaller scale to SLS-64 on 12 February 1941, when Admiral Hipper operating alone caught and sank 7 of its 19 ships). Alarmed by the tenor and sequence of the Admiralty's signals, PQ-17's escort commander and commodore complied at 2215, with the destroyers joining the cruisers to augment their force for the seemingly-imminent battle.</p><p>As it turned out, both sides flinched from phantoms. Misleading shadowers' reports that a battleship was included in the Covering Force and that carrier aircraft protected the convoy led Adm. Carls of Gruppe Nord to keep his surface units at Alta until the afternoon of 5 July, when it was clear that the convoy had scattered. And as early as 0230 on 5 July, the Admiralty admitted it was "not certain [the enemy ships] are at sea." Both actions were too late: the convoy was already dispersed, Tirpitz and her consorts were recalled at 2115 without ever firing a shot because they had been sighted by Allied subs and aircraft, and the slaughter of the hapless merchant ships was already well underway. By 13 July, an additional 19 freighters, oiler Aldersdale, and rescue ship Zaafaran were sunk by bombers and submarines, leaving only 11 merchantmen to straggle into Arkhangelsk.</p><p>Overshadowed by the larger tragedy and little remembered today, QP-13 blundered into an Allied minefield in the fog of the Denmark Strait on 5 July and lost minesweeper Niger and five of its freighters.</p><p>Although other convoys would lose greater percentage of their ships (notably TM-1, which lost 7 of its 9 tankers to U-boats in November 1942), no other lost more ships during the course of the war. The sense that PQ-17 had been abandoned to its fate shamed the Royal Navy, poisoned morale for many of the surviving merchant sailors, and was never forgotten or forgiven by some.</p>}

    description{<p>Despite the dimished German air threat, the British again suspended convoys to and from North Russia after the passage of JW-53 in February 1943. Not coincidentally, battlecruiser Scharnhorst -- her mine damage incurred during the daring 'Channel Dash' of a year earlier finally repaired -- arrived in Trondheim on 10 March. The convoys did not resume until November, when the lenthening hours of darkness again provided cover.</p><p>The first three convoys faced only submarine opposition, but the Germans mounted Operation Ostfront ('Eastern Front') against JW-55B. Tirpitz was again out of action after a daring midget submarine attack in September (Operation Source). But assisted by U-boats and Bv138s, RAdm. Bey with Scharnhorst and 5 DDs sortied for what was hoped would be a decisive blow.</p><p>The resulting Battle of the North Cape was indeed decisive, but not as the Kriegsmarine planned. The Luftwaffe lost contact on Christmas afternoon in stormy weather, and further U-boat contact reports proved misleading. Bey's sweeping destroyers came within 8 miles of the convoy, but not only failed to find it but lost touch with the flagship. Alerted by Ultra and brilliantly handled, the covering British cruisers twice fended off Scharnhorst before following her as she retired towards Alta. Despite running low on fuel, Adm. Fraser brought Duke of York, Jamaica, and 4 destroyers east to intercept. Though taken by surprise, the faster and more weatherly Scharnhorst almost escaped, but a 14" shell severed a vital steam pipe and slowed her enough to be caught by the destroyers. Their daring torpedo attack slowed the battlecruiser further, and her fate was sealed. With her went the last hope of interdicting the traffic to North Russia by German heavy ships.</p>}

    leader{"Pyrrhus of Epirus","M. Curius Dentatus"}
    description{<p>After an unsuccessful four year campaign in Sicily, Pyrrhus returned, again, to aid Tarentum. Pyrrhus’s reputation—which, even a hundred years later, was quite impressive—brought thousands of Samnites, Bruttians, Lucanians, Sabines, and other Italians back into his by-now depleted mercenary force. Led by his somewhat short-handed corps of war elephants, Pyrrhus, once again, marched on Rome. Consul M. Curius Dentatus (the last name coming from a particularly noticeable set of buck teeth) quickly gathered his consular army and moved south to intercept him. He camped about 130 miles southeast of Rome near the town of Beneventum (at that time named Maleventum; obviously as things got “better” the name changed) and waited for Pyrrhus.</p><p>Pyrrhus approached Beneventum with an army consisting of 20,000 foot, 3,000 cavalry and some 15 elephants. The cavalry were mostly his Thessalian units whereas, in addition to his Macedonian-style phalanxes, most of the 20,000 foot were sword-armed, Italian-colonial Greeks. The Roman army under the Consul Dentatus consisted of a fairly typical Consular army (17,000 foot and 1,200 cavalry), who’s contingent of alae sociorum was a bit reduced by sizeable defections of Sabines and other Italians to the Tarentine/Pyrrhic cause.</p><p>Pyrrhus’s patrols detected the Roman defensive positions and he decided on a surprise night attack. His approach march took longer than planned (Lex Murphus, no doubt), and the Romans, upon detecting the Epirote army, sprang to arms and repulsed the initial assault with Pyrrhus losing eight elephants.</p><p>Dentatus now decided to offer battle and fight Pyrrhus on the plain adjoining his camp. The initial Roman attack failed, due in part to Pyrrhus’s skillful use of his remaining elephants plus some stiff Epirote/mercenary resistance. However, a second Roman assault managed to stampede the elephants into their own positions. The shaken Macedonian phalanx retreated from the field in disorder, and the Romans had a victory—albeit just barely.</p><p>Dentatus’ victory convinced Pyrrhus to give up his dreams of western conquest and he departed for Greece. Casualties are unknown, but Pyrrhus returned to Greece with approximately 8,000 foot and 500 cavalry. He was killed in a minor engagement three years later, leaving the Southern Greeks on the Italian peninsula without strong leadership. In 272 BC Rome conquered Tarentum, and two years later she completed her subjugation of all Southern Italy with the capture of Rhegium.</p><p>Beneventum was the pivotal battle in the Roman Republic’s bid for Italian peninsular hegemony. It is the first of three battles (Cynoscephalae and Pydna are the other two) where the Roman Manipular Legion met—and defeated—a purely Alexander/Macedonian style army in a stand-up fight. It is also an interesting study in the Roman use of a fortified camp in support of its battle plan.</p>}

    description{<p>In the beginning, the First Punic War went pretty much in favor of the Romans. The Carthaginians were a naval power, and her land armies &mdash; ill-trained and with a poor appreciation of operations and tactics &mdash; fared poorly against the disciplined Roman legions. Surprisingly, however, Rome, even though her navy was built virtually from scratch, managed to land an apparent knock-out blow against the Carthaginian fleet off Ecnomus (Sicily) in 256 B.C. Following that victory, the Romans decided to bring the war to Africa and landed Marcus Atilius Regulus and his consular army near Carthage. Unfortunately for Regulus, most of his cavalry had been sent elsewhere. Even so, he had great initial success against the few forces the Carthaginians sent against him, and he was all set to deliver what he felt sure would be the coup de grace.</p><p>The Carthaginians, however, finally had a bit of luck. They managed to secure the services of a Spartan “general”, Xanthippus, who, while no genius, was one of the few people in the area who had any working knowledge of land army operations and tactics. He restructured the Carthaginian army, drilled it to an acceptable level of training, and explained to them how they could use the flat expanses of Northern Africa to their advantage. He then set out to lure Regulus into a fight, and the consul, despite the alarming indications that the Carthaginians were up to something new, took the bait. In mid-winter, 255 B.C., on the plains near the Bagradas River, Regulus and Xanthippus finally faced off. To counter the Carthaginian front wall of almost 100 elephants, Regulus deployed his maniples in a formation that shortened his flanks but extended his depth to withstand (at least to his way of thinking) the charge of the elephants. Unfortunately, his flank was protected by a woefully inadequate cavalry contingent, and the Carthaginian 8–1 (!!) superiority in horse would prove telling .... as it usually did. The Carthaginian war elephants kept the Roman infantry lines busy, her cavalry routed that of the Romans, the African phalanxes charged home and, together with the cavalry, they totally shattered Regulus’ legions. There would be no quick end to the war.</p>}

    description{<p>In 219 B.C., Hannibal Barca, commanding-general of the Carthaginians in Spain—and avowed enemy of Rome—led an army of some 35,000 men and 34 elephants across the Alps into Italy to challenge the growing mercantile power of the Republic of Rome. In 218 B.C., he defeated Sempronius’ legions when they rashly splashed across the icy Trebbia River to attack the Carthaginians. The Romans lost 20,000 men; in the ensuing winter, Hannibal lost all his elephants (save one) plus one of his eyes. He did, however, gain the allegiance of the vaunted, sword-swinging Celts. Advancing into central Italy the following spring, he ambushed Flaminius’ legions on the shores of Lake Trasimene, driving the entire army into the lake. A second Roman force had been lost. In both battles, the Romans, regardless of the situation, had used the same tactics they always used, relying on the weight of their infantry to break the center of the enemy (Carthaginian) line.</p><p>The Romans now adopted the strategy, propounded by consul, Q. Fabius Cunctator (the Delayer), of avoiding battle with Hannibal, hoping he’d get tired of stomping around the peninsula and simply go home. It didn’t work; at least not initially. Hannibal took the opportunity to lay waste to the countryside, forcing the Roman people to send another army against him. Therefore, in the summer of 216 B.C., the two newly-appointed consuls, Caius Terentius Varro and Lucius Aemilius Paullus, led their newly-raised consular armies to join with a similar force under previous consuls Servilius and Atilius. This huge army of (supposedly) eight double legions—some 75,000+ men, the largest, by far, yet seen in Roman history —found Hannibal seizing the grain depot at Cannae, just south of the Aufidus (today, the Ofanto) river. Paullus, the more experienced general, cautioned against facing the Carthaginians too soon. Unfortunately, it was Varro’s day to command (they alternated command each day, a remarkable system virtually guaranteed to produce disastrous results) and he was intent on avenging the two previous losses.</p><p>The battlefield at Cannae would, at first glance, seem ideal for the Romans’ purposes: the river and the hills would anchor their flanks and prevent the fabled Numidian cavalry from running amok. Unfortunately, the short frontage, between the river and the hills, forced the Romans to squeeze their far-too-many maniples into an unwieldy formation (and the Numidians ran amok anyway). The result was the greatest defeat ever suffered by a Roman army, and a battle so masterfully fought by Hannibal, a military genius in the same rank as Alexander or Caesar, that it is, even today, the subject of intense scrutiny and study.</p>}

    leader{"Hannibal Barca","P. Cornelius Scipio"}
    description{<p>Many historians consider Zama one of the most important battles in Western civilization. Perhaps that is reading too much into its obvious political conclusion: Rome’s Mediterranean expansion. With wonderful hindsight, however, it is fairly easy to see that Carthage was doomed as a political entity; her inefficient, city-state form of government was no match for the Roman concept of people and state. Rome’s ascendancy was simply a matter of time, and Zama helped to hasten that date.</p><p>From a military point of view, however, Zama is an immensely important battle. On one level it shows what a genius Hannibal truly was; his army at Zama was inferior to Scipio’s; yet, Hannibal came rather close to winning. On a loftier plane, Zama is the proving ground of the flexibility of the Roman legionary system—as implemented by the insightful mind of Scipio Africanus—and its superiority to the powerful, yet linearly rigid, Macedonian system. The latter would live on for another 50 or so years, suffering further repeated blows at Cynoscephalae (see below), Magnesia (Antiochus and the end of the Seleucids) and Pydna (Perseus and the end of Macedonia). The Roman legions would continue to hold sway for the next several centuries. Delbruck further adds to its importance by arguing that it was the first use of echelon tactics; i.e., the different lines of troops were not there to simply provide depth but to be used for differing tactical purposes—as well as acting as a reserve.</p><p>In 210 B.C., with Hannibal’s army still on the loose in southern Italy, the young Publius Cornelius Scipio was chosen to command the Roman forces in Spain. Scipio was something of a surprising choice, given his youth and lack of experience in public office—although not overly shocking given Scipio’s ideas on how to conduct the war against Carthage and the people’s demand for some sort of action. (Fabius Cunctator was still implementing the theory that Rome could bore Hannibal to death; exhausted by ennui, he would then go home. It pretty much worked.)</p><p>In a few short years, the son of a consul from the First Punic War had proven himself to be an exceptional field commander, with a victory over Hasdrubal at Baecula and a masterful, tactical showpiece win at Ilipa. In 205 B.C. he was elected consul where, in the Senate, he went face-to-face with the delaying strategy of Fabius. Scipio advocated taking the war directly to Carthage; the only way to get Hannibal out of Italy was to force him to return to Africa to defend his city-state. To this end—albeit with some senatorial reluctance—he was handed the command of Sicily and its two legions, mostly remnants and veterans of the Cannae fiasco. After raising some additional forces to flesh out his consular army, he set off for North Africa where, in a series of stunning maneuvers, he won several land and naval battles, forcing the Carthaginians to sue for peace.</p><p>In the meantime, with Mago’s army having been destroyed in Liguria, the Carthaginians demanded Hannibal return to Carthage, as Mago’s defeat had nullified whatever “Italian strategy” Hannibal had. Hannibal’s arrival seemed to strengthen the backbone of the Carthaginians, and they repudiated the peace treaty through a variety of actions that the Romans, as was their wont, assigned to the usual Punic Treachery. Hannibal’s army was in bad straits, however, especially in the all-important area of cavalry.  Even worse, after a series of political and military maneuvers involving claims to the Numidian throne, Scipio had acquired the services of Masinissa, the new Numidian king, along with the cream of his capable light cavalry. Although Hannibal was aware of these developments, he assumed that he could bring Scipio to battle before Masinissa arrived. And to strengthen his outnumbered cavalry wing (which included about 2000 Numidians led by one of Masinissa’s leftover rivals), he quickly trained a corps of 80 or so war elephants. Both generals were now set for battle; all they needed was a place.</p><p>The site of the Zama battlefield has never been firmly pinpointed. If you read Polybius/Livy closely, it seems to have taken place closer to the village of Naraggara. We have used the map from H.H. Scullard’s book, Scipio Africanus, Politician & Soldier, (it also appears in Liddel Hart’s book, with an added cross-battlefield trail) which is based on that contained in the Kromayer-Veith Atlas (a German work extremely difficult to obtain through the normal, local-library channels—or through any channels, for that matter). If interested, we suggest you consult Scullard for a discussion on all possible sites, of which Veith’s selection—and our choice—appears the most reasonable.</p><p>Zama is pretty much a set-piece battle. We have provided only one scenario, although the players may feel free to change deployments within the parameters of the original dispositions. There are some problems in terms of unit types and numbers, and where/how they deployed. We do know that Scipio had an augmented, two-legion consular army; see the notes on the Roman army under their deployment. Hannibal’s somewhat hastily assembled army is somewhat easier to pin down, although numbers and weapons system types are evasive.</p><p>It appears that Hannibal, aware of his inferiority in mounted troops, placed the onus of victory on his infantry. To that end, he hoped that one of two things would happen: either his elephants would drive off the Roman cavalry, or the Roman cavalry would recklessly pursue the undermanned Carthaginian horsemen off the battlefield, allowing Hannibal’s infantry to go head-to-head with the legions.</p><p>Well, the elephants proved a bust (Scipio pretty much saw to that), but Hannibal was on the money about the Roman cavalry chasing the Africans hither and yon. That left it up to the infantry, and, despite the eagerness of some of Hannibal’s newest recruits to be elsewhere, his veterans were pretty much holding their own against Scipio’s relentless legionnaires when Laelius returned with the cavalry, hit Hannibal’s lines from the rear, and sealed Carthage’s doom. Hannibal, himself, escaped, but the 2nd Punic War was over—and so was Carthage’s prominence.</p><p>Hannibal, still a fairly young man, sought employment in the Near East. He was on the field at Magnesia when the Romans decided to put a quick end to the machinations of the Seleucid ruler, Antiochus the Great, in 190 B.C. (So was Scipio, although the latter was ill and had little input). It is something of a measure of Antiochus’ lack of genius that, having one of history’s greatest tacticians at his side, he failed to put him to any significant use. Rome eventually decided that Hannibal was a major pain regardless of where he was, so they declared him an outlaw and finally tracked him down in Bythnia (northern Turkey), where he had been helping King Prusias in his contre-temps with Pergamum. With his house surrounded, Hannibal, bitter and tired, committed suicide.</p>}

    leader{"King Phillip V of Macedon","T. Quinctius Flaminius"}
    description{<p>By the end of the 3rd century, B.C., Macedon, and her king, Phillip V was still the dominant force in the eastern Mediterranean. Her army, a direct descendent of Alexander’s, was still much feared, as was the Macedonian style of warfare, which still emphasized combined arms but placed far more reliance on the power of the phalanx than Alexander ever did—or would have. While Rome was going the way of increased flexibility and maneuver, the Macedonian phalanx was becoming, if possible, more rigid than ever.</p><p>During the 2nd Punic War, Phillip sided with Carthage. Although this arrangement produced no pitched battles between Rome and Macedon, it became known, historically, as the First Macedonian War. After some indecisive skirmishing, an uneasy peace was negotiated that enabled Rome to concentrate its energies on defeating Carthage. Legend has it that Phillip supplied Hannibal with several thousand men at Zama, but there appears to be no support for this story.</p><p>In 200 BC, with Rome now the dominant power in Italy and the Western Mediterranean, Rhodes and Pergamum petitioned her for aid against continuing Macedonian aggression in the Dardanelles and Egypt. This petition focused Roman attention on the Aegean and its unresolved business with Phillip. Rome demanded complete Macedonian withdrawal from Greece. Phillip agreed in part but wanted to maintain control over Demetrius in Thessaly, Chalcis in Euboea, and Corinth in Achaea, which the king had called the “fetters of Greece”. A Greek delegation sent to Rome gave the Senate a lesson in Greek geography and the negotiations ended in an impasse. However, as a result, the Senate voted Consul Lucius Quinctius Flamininus two Roman Legions plus 6,000 allied foot and 300 allied cavalry to prosecute the Second Macedonian War to conclusion.</p><p>Upon arrival in Greece, Consul Flamininus conducted a series of negotiations that allied most of Greece with Rome for its coming showdown with Phillip. This gave the Roman army, reinforced by almost 10,000 men from the Aetolian League, a grand total of 23,000 foot and 1,100 cavalry to face Phillip’s 23,500 foot and 2,000 cavalry. From somewhere—probably a gift from Masinissa—Flamininus also managed to attract the services of 20 elephants, which were to play a surprisingly decisive role in the coming battle. Aficionados of Alexander the Great will notice the diminution of the Macedonian cavalry wing, despite its numerical superiority to that of the Romans, both in numbers and effectiveness. This was due, in part, to the hilly and rocky Greek terrain, most of which negated the capabilities of cavalry; Cynoscephalae would be a major example. It also reflected a reduced appreciation of Alexandrian tactics. And, given the equality of strength in both armies, the approaching battle would be won by the respective tactical systems and not weight of numbers.</p><p>Both armies lurched forward in an attempt to seek each other out. Phillip and Flamininus knew they could not keep their respective coalitions in the field indefinitely, so each wanted to fight quickly. Near Pharae, in Thessaly, reconnaissance forces from both sides came into contact, although no battle occurred because the respective commanders felt the terrain was too constricted by walls and enclosed farms. The Macedonians then headed for a supply region to replenish their stocks of food. The Romans moved parallel to the Macedonians to cut them off from the needed grain, with the two forces being separated by a long ridge called Cynoscephalae (so named for its resemblance to a “dog’s head”). On the third day of marching a torrential storm arose drenching the forces and causing a heavy fog. The Macedonians tried to march on but could not make any headway in the storm. They withdrew to camp, leaving a strong outpost on the ridge. The Roman army stayed in camp but sent out a reconnaissance party to locate the Macedonians. With a heavy fog obscuring visibility, the two patrols bumped into each other on the rain-soaked ridge. With the Macedonians holding the heights, both sides sent back for reinforcements. The battle of Cynoscephalae was on.</p><p>Flamininus reluctantly sent reinforcements, forcing the Macedonians off the ridge. Phillip felt compelled to reinforce his exposed unit and prevent its destruction. These fresh Macedonian forces reclaimed the ridge from the Romans as the fog began to lift. Perceiving an opportunity to destroy part of the Roman army, Phillip now reluctantly committed his entire army. Flamininus followed suit, and a full-scale, pitched battle began.</p><p>Phillip took personal command of his right wing, and as soon as it formed on the ridge he doubled the depth of the phalanx and attacked the Roman left. This maneuver was, momentarily, successful; however, it separated the Macedonian army into two sections, with the Macedonian left wing under Nicanor still deploying from march column. Flamininus, seizing the moment, sent his right wing, lead by his elephants, slamming into the Macedonian left. An unknown Roman tribune, most likely from the Triarii, noticing that the Macedonian army was now split in two, exposing the flanks of the phalanxes, seized the initiative—and the day (carpe diem, for those of you who collect Latin idioms)—by leading 20 Roman maniples (the entire principes and triarii lines from one Roman legion) into the rear of the Macedonian right wing. This Roman maneuver—a text-book example of flexibility versus rigidity—shattered the Macedonian army and Phillip’s hopes of Greek hegemony, leading to a swiftly negotiated conclusion to the Second Macedonian War.</p><p>Even more important, Cynoscephalae was the first major confrontation between the Roman legions and a full-blown Alexandrian/Macedonian army led by phalanxes. (Both Hannibal and Pyrrhus adapted the Macedonian system rather than used it.) While Phillip’s phalanxes could not be budged in a head-to-head confrontation (the legions that attacked them frontally suffered heavy losses; see the notes on the Phalanx in the terminology section), they could, if outflanked, be easily defeated. Both the difficulty of the terrain at Cynoscephalae and the ability of the legion to maneuver freely, and in sections, enabled this to happen. The day of the phalanx was rapidly drawing to a conclusion, a curtain that would finally be drawn some 30 years later, at Pydna.</p>}

The Ju87 had proven too vulnerable for this kind of fighting and the Me110 was outclassed by single-engined fighters.

Göring blasted the fighter arm for being insufficiently aggressive and promoted ambitious junior officers to command the Jagdgeschwadern, such as Adolf Galland and Werner Mölders.</p><p>One other change had occurred a few days previously.

Göring had shifted the focus of the attacks to the southeast of England, reinforcing Luftflotte 2 with fighters from Luftflotte 3. Fighter Command targets—airfields and key sector stations—were battered again and again.</p><p>Generalfeldmarschall Kesselring, commanding Luftflotte 2, employed a bewildering variety of tactics, including the ‘rolling attack’, following one wave with another shortly thereafter. Often a wave would split up and strike out for different targets, confusing the defence.</p><p>As bombers pounded the airfields, operational efficiency declined. Runways were potholed, maintenance hangars blown up, living quarters demolished and vital telephones cut. But Fighter Command was never knocked out. Holes could be filled and maintenance completed at fighter dispersal. Airmen and women lived in tents under summer skies and telephone lines were spliced back together. The closest the Luftwaffe came to success was at Biggin Hill, where the operations room was briefly knocked out. It was the high water mark of the attacks on the RAF but achieved at great cost to the Germans.</p><p>The RAF had been stretched, but not to breaking point. New squadrons, such as those of the Poles, Czechs and Canadians, entered operational service. Prime Minister Winston Churchill believed the air battle was now under control. The RAF was turning the corner.</p><p>Then, without warning, the Luftwaffe changed strategy. The Battle of the Airfields was over. The Battle of London was about to begin.</p>}

They avoided the airfields and headed straight for London’s docks, raining blast bombs and incendiaries down on the city’s vital supply line. The city burned.</p><p>The change in strategy was the culmination of debates within the Luftwaffe. Britain hadn’t surrendered after weeks of attacks on the RAF. Generalfeldmarschall Kesselring of Luftflotte 2 asserted that a major effort against the nation’s capital would finish the job, but his counterpart at Luftflotte 3, Generalfeldmarschall Sperrle, demanded that Fighter Command’s airfields first be finished off. ‘Smiling Albert’ Kesselring won the debate, arguing that attacks on London would in any case force the RAF fighters up, where they could be shot down.</p><p>The RAF fighters certainly came up in numbers. Even 12 Group’s ‘Big Wing’ Balbos were able to form in time to meet the London raids. The climax came on 15 September when massive raids on London took losses so large the claims resembled cricket scores. This marked the end of the attempt to defeat Britain with massed daylight raids. The night-time ‘Blitz’ effort, which the RAF could do little to stop, began to increase.</p>}

From October to the end of the year the Luftwaffe day attacks mainly employed fighter-bombers—the Jabos. Laden Me109s and Me110s would zip in at high altitude and lob bombs at targets. Sometimes two or three such raids would stream over England, one after the other. These were harassing attacks, designed to keep the RAF off-balance and on the defensive. The Luftwaffe fighter pilots hated the new form of warfare and complained it was hurting morale.</p><p>In addition to the Jabos, the Ju87 Stuka dive-bombers returned to attack shipping in the Channel and Thames Estuary. And then the Italians arrived in their gaily-coloured aeroplanes, ill-trained and ill-equipped for this air battle. Their hapless intervention resulted, on 11 November, in a beating.</p><p>31 October was declared the end of the battle, though the Luftwaffe continued to raid into 1941. In November the architect of the RAF victory, Air Chief Marshal Dowding, and his right-hand man, Air Vice-Marshal Keith Park of 11 Group, were removed from their jobs to be replaced by commanders who would take the offensive against the enemy. The next great air battle would be fought over continental Europe.</p>}

Although the operation started with gret surprise at dawn, a group of Partisan officers in training delayed the German paratroops long enough so that Tito and his staff escaped over the mountains. By mid-day, strong Partisan forces began to move in and both sides entered into a pitched and vicious battle at the town cemetary located on some high ground outside of town. Heavy losses occurred, but still without serious result from the German perspective &mdash; all they took away was a bullet-riddled uniform belonging to the untouchable Tito.</p>}{

Since minor patrols with small enemy parties were a nightly occurrence, the fire did not raise significant alarm among the defenders. At 0200 Ichiki ordered 2nd company of the Japanese II/28th Regiment to charge across the sandbar of the Ilu River (known as Alligator Creek to the US Marines). The goal was to push past the defensive perimeter and on to Henderson Field. Facing them were the US Marines of G Company of the II/1st Regiment and two platoons of the 1st Special Weapons Battalion.

This was developed by Colonel Nakagawa, commander of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the 14th Infantry Division. Prior to the invasion of this strategic island, the defenders withheld all fire to mask their positions from US naval bombardment. This tactic continued on D-Day itself, allowing the three regiments (1st, 5th and 7th) of the 1st Marine Division to reach the beaches under very light fire. But progress inland was slow and with a terrible cost in lives. By the 20th, the 1/1st Marines had reached the base of Hill 154, a barren wall of coral infested with hidden defenders and protected from the overlook knows as Suicide Ridge. Captain Everett Pope led C Company up that wall, fighting valiantly and managing to overtake the position. During the night, the Japanese assaulted the Marines on the hill repeatedly. In between charges, the Marines countered by tossing rocks (to sound like grenade landings) as well as some actual grenades from their dwindling supply. When the Marines finally ran out of ammunition, Captain Pope rallied the few remaining Marines around himself to all fight back the repeated charges with little more than their bare hands.</p>}

The intense fighting to the northeast had sapped most of the British reserves, leaving only the 5th Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (DCLI), which was snatching much needed rest in the outskirts of Fontaine-Etoupefour. It was decided that the gains outweighed the risk and the 5th DCLI formes up behind the positions held by 4th Somerset Light Infantry along the Caen-Evracy road.

The plan was for the 4th Somerset to advance over the summit. The 4th Wiltshire (Wilts) would swing around to the left, while the 5th Wilts swung around to the right. Things went badly from the beginning when shells from their own artillery landed among the assault troops of the 4th Wilts.

The German AT guns responded and knocked out several Tanks and Carriers. German armor quickly added to the number of British vehicles knocked out. The British forces pushed on with classic British determination, and the assault troops of the 129th closed on the German positions. The German Grenadiers opened up and began inflicting casualties on the British infantry. The defense of the Hill was declared a "Schwerpunkt" and the Germans committed their reserves - the dreaded Nebelwerfers of the 8th Werfer Brigade begin to rain death and destruction.

The 7th Hampshires, with elements of the 9th RTR, would advance down into the valley, pass through Maltot, and dig in on the southern ridge overlooking the town.

The advance went well until the British closed on the town, then shot and shell rang out from the village and from German AT guns on Hill 112. Compounding the situation, a platoon of Tigers from the 102nd Heavy Tank Regiment had advanced almost simultaneously to support the defenders of Maltot. The 7th Hampshires bypassedthe town defenders and thrust toward their objective, the southern heights. The 7th battalion HQ and reserve companies followed up closely with the intent of mopping up Maltot, but the Germans were not going to give up one of the few dominating features on the eastern flank of the hill. Units of the 12th SS Hitlerjugend were dispatched along the River Orne to support the eastern flank. Meanwhile the 10th SS reconnaissance, were rushed in from their marshalling areas to help stem the British tide.

The German losses mounted and they retreated.</p><p>At 12:15, the Germans attacked again, driving through the defenses and into the center of the village. Utter confusion reigned amid the smoke and fire of the burning houses. The battle broke into numerous skirmishes throughout the forest, village and rail lines. The situation grew desperate for the Poles as their guns were either disabled or ran out of ammunition. The Polish cavalry was being pushed back with heavy losses. In a desperate gamble, the Poles ordered tankettes of the 21st Armored Battalion to charge the Germans deployed in the village. This gained the Poles enough time for the return of the armored trains. The battle raged on until 17:00, at which point the Germans withdrew from Mokra.</p><p>The German 1st Panzer Division captured the city of Kłobuck directly to the south of Mokra, forcing the Poles to retreat from Mokra during the night. Both sides lost hundreds of men, tanks and horses in the vicious fighting that day.</p>}

    description{<p>General von Kleist’s XXII Army Corps (2nd Panzer, 4th Light and 3rd Mountain Divisions) hit the Polish Army “Kraków” from the south, after moving through Slovakia to bypass the Polish defenses in Silesia. The Polish General Staff was surprised by the German decision to throw a strong motorized unit into the mountainous area of Podhale. Weak Polish defenses, comprised of the Border Defense Corps, were unable to withstand the strong German advance. Facing the Germans was General Antonii Szylling, commander of the Polish Army “Kraków”. This surprise move by the Germans put General Szylling’s entire army in danger. He immediately ordered his fastest reserve unit, the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade led by Colonel Stanisław Maczek, to block the German advance. Countless times, Polish and German armored units clashed in the mountain passes. One such engagement took place near the village of Jordanów. The Poles need to hold back or delay the Germans long enough to reorganize their defenses.</p><p>Maczek and his troops fought very effectively, slowing the German advance for five days. Despite numerical and technical superiority, the German advance was slowed to a crawl, advancing less than 10 km. per day. The Germans called the 10th Cavalry Brigade “Die Schwarze Brigade” – “The Black Brigade”, because of the black jackets worn by the Polish mechanized troops. After intense fighting, the Germans broke the Kraków Army’s front to the north of Maczek’s position, after which Maczek’s brigade was pulled out of the front line.</p><p>Stanisław Maczek became one of the most famous Polish panzer leaders, fighting from the first to the last day of the war. After the fall of Poland, his troops were evacuated to France via Romania. Maczek commanded the Polish 10th Armored Cavalry Brigade in the French campaign. After the collapse of France, his troops were evacuated to Britain. They returned to France in 1944 as the 1st Polish Armor Division, taking part in Operation Totalize through the Falaise pocket, and towards the end of the war captured the main Kriegsmarine base in Wilhelmshaven.</p>}

After a day of battle, the Polish lines had been partially broken and German tanks poured onto the open plains near Piotrków. This area was occupied by the Polish 19th Infantry Division of the Polish Reserve Army “Prusy”. These forces were urgently preparing themselves against the German attack.</p><p>On September 5 on the outskirts of Piotrkow, a bloody battle took place. German tanks of the 1st and 4th Panzer Divisions, supported by artillery and the Luftwaffe, broke through the Polish positions and captured Piotrków, opening the way to Warsaw.

Only 4 battalions of infantry and one battery of artillery were left in Warsaw. The Polish Commander in Chief, Marshal of Poland Edward Śmigły-Rydz, ordered the creation of an improvised Command of the Defence for Warsaw. General Walerian Czuma was named its commander. Czuma and the mayor of Warsaw, Stefan Starzyński, began to organize the Civil Guard to replace the police forces and fire fighters.

Barricades had been erected on the main streets leading into Warsaw in order to slow the German assault. This allowed well placed Polish 75mm anti-tank guns to ambush the invaders. The streets took on a hellish aspect as the Germans poured heavy artillery into the city, while their pioneer units attempted to blow up the street barricades. At the same time the Poles pumped large amounts of turpentine onto the streets, creating burning fire traps to which men and tanks fell prey.</p><p>The German forces suffered heavy casualties and had to retreat westward to help thwart the Bzura River counter offensive (Firefight #7).

In the first phase of the battle (Sept 9-12), two Polish armies, “Pomorze” and the “Poznań”, attacked the left flank of the German 8th Army, threatening the communication lines of the German armies moving towards Warsaw. The scale and the speed of the Polish operation surprised the German general staff, forcing them to halt their advance towards Warsaw and the Vistula river. The Germans reacted quickly, assembling all of their available fast moving mobile units to deploy against the Polish counter-offensive. The German 8th Army nearly reached its breaking point, but managed to hold its positions thanks to the quick response of the 10th Army’s mobile units.</p><p>During the second phase of the battle (Sept 13-15), Polish forces were trying to establish a bridgehead over the river Bzura, in order to open a road corridor for the deployment of Polish reinforcement armies destined for Warsaw.

    description{<p>The Poles had originally planned to make a defensive stand along the Vistula river, but because this line was overrun, the Polish Commander in Chief, Edward Śmigły-Rydz, decided to withdraw his troops towards the so-called ‘Romanian Bridgehead’. This was an easily defendable area in the south-eastern region of Poland, comprised of moors and rivers. This area also bordered Romania, from which Allied aid was supposed to be sent to Poland.</p><p>The plan was realistic and feasible, since Germany had turned most of its mobile units towards the Bzura river area in order to counter the ongoing Polish counteroffensive going on there. The Romanian Bridgehead could draw military forces from the northern, central and southern Polish fronts, instantly creating a strong defensive military position. Moreover, the Allies had promised to initiate an offensive on the Western front and this would greatly decrease the German pressure and number of units on the Polish front, since the Germans would have to re-deploy armies to the west. However, the unexpected Soviet surprise attack and the lack of Western Allied support put an end to these plans. The area of the Romanian Bridgehead was attacked and penetrated by Soviet armored units, forcing Śmigły to evacuate Poland, and as a result, he was no longer able to coordinate actions on the Polish fronts. The Polish armies, however, continued to steadfastly march towards the south-east where they encountered the German XXII Corps, which had out-distanced the main German supply lines and was low on fuel and ammunition. The Polish forces attacked the Germans, but did not coordinate their attacks. The Germans exploited their central position, beating the Polish forces piecemeal one after the other. The first battle, pitting the German XXII Corps against the Polish Central Front armies, took place between Sept 17 and 20 and became known as the First Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski. The Second Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski took place between Sept 22 and 27, where the XXII Corps faced the Polish Northern front forces.</p><p>On Sept 18, in an attempt to break through the German defenses and execute their orders to proceed south, Polish soldiers from the Central Front (previously armies “Kraków” and “Lublin”) attacked the city of Tomaszów Lubelski. The Poles were unaware of the Soviet invasion and that their struggle no longer had the same strategic significance it had just the day before. The Polish forces included one of the largest Polish armored formations of the time, the Warsaw Armored Motorized Brigade (32 light tanks, 48 tankettes), which led the attack on the city. The main Polish assault hit the southern section of Tomaszów Lubelski. Here, massed Polish armor clashed with agile German anti-tank defenses. The Polish tanks and tankettes managed to break through the German lines, leaving their infantry behind, but were stopped by a series of Panzer counter-attacks. Both sides took tremendous losses.</p><p>The Poles were stopped by the German 4th Light Division and 2nd Panzer Division and had to retreat from the field of battle. This three day battle was the largest armor battle of the Polish campaign. By battle’s end, the Polish troops were surrounded, out of ammunition, and only a few survivors managed to break through the German ring and escape to the temporary safety of Romania or Hungary.</p>}

Fearing an imminent attack from France, the Wehrmacht was under increasing pressure to conclude the Polish campaign. The Polish decision to consolidate and build a fighting force in the Romanian Bridgehead was a sound strategic move. The area was easy to defend and had direct access to potential Allied support through Romania. However, the Soviet attack of Sept 17th was a disaster for the Polish defense. It changed the European political balance and put an end to French plans of attacking Germany that year.</p><p>The Polish border positions along the Russian front were guarded by a thin cordon of Border Defense Corps, which could not hold back the massed Soviet invasion. Only one Polish position (the Sarny Fortified Area), that was guarding the Polesie swamps, held the “Red Tide” for a few days. The Sarny Fortified Area was a line of bunkers and trenches built along both sides of the Sluch river near the town of Sarny, close to the Soviet border. For many years, the Polish military considered the Soviet Union as Poland’s main enemy. As a result, a major construction project of fortifications up to five kilometers in depth began in 1936.</p><p>Most of the Sarny Fortified Area garrison had been redeployed to Poland’s western fortifications in preparation for the expected German invasion. The remaining soldiers were ordered in mid-September 1939 to abandon the bunkers and to move with their equipment towards the Romanian Bridgehead. On September 16, the eve of Soviet attack on Poland, there were only small formations remaining - altogether numbering some 4000 soldiers guarding 80 kilometers of border. The Poles had no heavy equipment, because it had been sent towards the German border in the summer of 1939. The Sarny Fortified Area was attacked by the Soviet 60th Rifle Division. The Polish defenders held the fortifications for three days, but on September 20, facing encirclement, they were forced to withdraw. However, not all of the soldiers received the order to withdraw and in some places the Poles resisted until September 25. Several soldiers in bunkers refused to surrender and had to be blown up by Red Army engineers.</p><p>The main Soviet assault was committed against the “Tynne Sector” of the Sarny Fortyfied Area. In order to pin the Polish troops in the northern fortifications, Soviet soldiers from the 194th Rifles Regiment were ordered to attack the northern “Polany Sector”. The Polish bunkers in front of the village of Polany were set up between lakes and swamps. Due to the marshy terrain, the Soviet soldiers could not deploy their heavy weapons in this sector. Therefore, the burden of fighting fell to the line soldiers. They paid dearly in blood for every meter of Polish ground they took.</p>}

Thus began a race between the invading armies to conquer this great Polish city, a historical symbol of Polish independence and freedom. The Germans and Soviets both targeted the strategic high ground on the south-eastern outskirts of Lwów, near the village of Winniki. This high ground, overlooking Lwów, offered an excellent location for artillery spotting. The sudden appearance of the 24th Soviet Tank Brigade swept the Poles from the area. Unexpectedly, the Soviets were attacked by the German 2nd Mountain Division which also had been ordered to take the Winniki hills! This was one of the first Soviet/German engagements of WWII, where soldiers of the German 137 Mountain Rifle Regiment, 2nd Mountain Division engaged the Soviet 24th and 10th Armored Brigades. On September 19, 1939, on the hills near Lwów, were played out scenes that would repeat themselves on a much grander scale two years later.

The Poles decided to capitulate to the Soviets, because resistance seemed futile from a strategic viewpoint and would result in many unnecessary civilian casualties. The terms of surrender were negotiated and an agreement was signed, but the Soviets did not comply with its conditions and imprisoned all Polish officers.

    description{<p>The Polish Border Defense Corps was the only regular Polish defense on the eastern border on the day of the Soviet invasion. After a series of border fights, the Polish forces were concentrated under the command of General Wilhelm Orlik-Rückemann and designated the Border Defense Corps group. This group started to fight its way to the south-west through Soviet lines and towards the Hungarian border as ordered by the Polish General Staff.</p><p>They crossed the Bug river to rendezvous with the only remaining large Polish fighting unit - the Independent Operational Group (IOG) ”Polesie”. During their march, the Poles were pursued and finally caught by the Soviet 45th Rifles Division. The Poles were so exhausted that many soldiers refused to fight. The Polish commander, General Wilhelm Orlik-Rückemann, prepared a screening action with his last battleworthy units along a line drawn between two small villages. The western village, Wólka Wytycka, was held by troops of the “Sarny” battalion and was screened from the Soviets by Lake Wytyckie. The eastern village, Wytyczno, was held by troops of the “Polesie” battalion and lay on open ground. Behind this screen, columns of disorganized Polish Border Defense Corps soldiers were trying to continue their march away from Soviet pursuit and towards IOG “Polesie” positions.</p><p>The Soviets are attacking aggressively from the south, supported by artillery and tanks, while trying to flank the Poles from the east with their cavalry. The Poles must conserve their resources and try to hold back the large tank supported Soviet force as long as possible.</p><p>The Soviets managed to seize Wytyczno and Polish officers were unable to rally their soldiers to counter attack. In spite of this failure, the shielding action did manage to delay the Soviets long enough to permit the escape of many Polish units. Unable to continue the battle, the battered shielding force began to disband under the cover of darkness. The battle resulted in the destruction of the Polish Border Defense Corps as a viable fighting entity and allowed the Soviets to complete occupying the territory up to the Soviet - German demarcation line without any further significant resistance.</p>}

    description{<p>On Sept 9th, the Independent Operational Group “Polesie”, led by General Franciszek Kleeberg, was created to guard the Polesie area and the Brześć (Brest) fortress against German units (including Guderian’s XIX Corps) that had broken through the northern Polish defenses. It successfully managed to slow Guderian’s advance during the battles of Brześć (Sept 14-17) and Kobryń (Sept 16-18). On Sept 17th, General Kleeberg moved south to execute his orders to evacuate his men to Hungary and Romania. However, the rapid Soviet advance from the east cut off his southerly route and the group turned westwards to march towards Warsaw to help in the city’s defense. But Warsaw surrendered, so Kleeberg decided to march towards Dęblin, a major Polish Army supply depot, since his men needed ammunition and heavy equipment. Group “Polesie” successfully broke through Soviet lines at the battles of Jabłonów and Milanów (Sept 29-30). The Germans tracked the movement of this last large Polish formation and moved the XIV Motorized Corps, led by Gustav Anton von Wietersheim, to intercept it. After the capitulation of Warsaw on Sept 28 and the capitulation of Hel on Oct 1st, the Independent Operational Group “Polesie” was the last organized Polish fighting unit.</p><p>Near the city of Kock, the Polesie Group has been battling the German XIV Motorized Corps for 5 fierce days (Oct 1-5). On October 5th, as Hitler is celebrating a victory parade in Warsaw, the Poles are in the process of surrounding the German 13th Motorized Division, which has been isolated from the rest of its corps. The small village of Wola Gułowska is at the center of this engagement, where the fate of the battle of Kock will be determined. Both sides are attacking furiously, often engaging in hand to hand combat.</p><p>The position became perilous for the Germans as they were surrounded by the Polish cavalry. General Otto, commander of the 13th Motorized Division, ordered his soldiers to withdraw. The engagement was won by Poles, but all of their ammunition was spent, with no chance of resupply. On Oct 6, out of ammunition, out of supplies, and surrounded on all sides, General Kleeberg capitulated to the Germans. He was the last Polish general to surrender in the September Campaign.</p>}

However, a coalition of France’s enemies, led by Great Britain, desperately resists his ambitions. Great Britain, in dire need of resources, is capturing American ships that are supplying France, confiscating their cargoes and impressing some of their sailors to serve in its Royal Navy.</p><p>The young United States objects. Eager to defend its sovereign rights and to strengthen its position in North America, the United States declares war on Britain on June 18, 1812. Taking advantage of the British army’s struggles against Napoleon in Europe, American forces invade Canada on July 12, 1812. The goal is to drive the British from their last remaining colony on North American soil. Surprised, Britain reels from the attack and now has to face another enemy threat on another continent.</p><p>In 1812 - The Invasion of Canada, players take on the roles of the major factions that participated in the War of 1812. On the British side these are represented by the British Regulars (Redcoats), Canadian Militia and Native Americans; the American Regular Army and American Militia comprise the American side. Players for each side will strategize together in order to plan and conduct their campaigns. Each side will attempt to capture Objective cities and forts on the map. When a truce is called, the side that controls the most enemy Objectives wins.</p>}

    description{<p>Breitenfeld is unquestionably the most famous battle of the Thirty Years War. But the question is why? While an important battle that marked a major change of initiative in the war, it did not destroy the Imperial-League army completely, nor did it speed the end of the war. Some have tried pouring additional significance into it such as a clash of Swedish versus Spanish military systems or Protestant work ethic versus Catholic work ethic. These efforts break down under scrutiny and recent scholarship. The armies were not as dramatically different as many thought and idea that a “Protestant” work ethic was somehow superior on the battlefield is just plain wrong sectarianism.</p><p>The contrast between the tactics and formations of the opposing armies has been overplayed. Two specific areas that have been popularized are the Swedish “Linear” formations versus Spanish style “Tercios” for the infantry and Swedish charging cavalry versus Caracole cavalry (see the notes on the Swedish Army). The Swedish brigades were unique to Gustav Adolf’s army, but they were based on the Dutch model. The Imperial-League Army was not organized as tercios, but with regiments along the German style, the same German style that served with the Spanish in Flanders, and the same German style that was to be adopted as the official organizational model for the Spanish tercios in 1634. The German style had been around for some time and was a tried and true organization. The German style was simpler to train and master than the Swedish brigade. It would be the same style adopted by the Swedes not long after Gustav Adolf was killed.</p><p>Three tactics or techniques the Swedes had practiced that the Imperial-League Army was not expecting was the triple rank salvo, regimental artillery and the use of commanded musketeers to support their cavalry. While making a contribution, it is doubtful that these tactics were decisive. Some were controversial and often failed to yield the desired result. The Imperial Army did copy the regimental artillery and adopted a modified version of the salvo, but never did think much of the commanded musketeers. Superior Swedish artillery was mentioned as being annoying, but Tilly held the advantage of the ground which reduced the overall impact of the Swedish guns.</p><p>Tilly’s real problem wasn’t superior enemy tactics; it was superior numbers of the Swedish-Saxon Army. Above all, it was the size and length of their line of battle that spread his army thin, forcing him into one long line to prevent being outflanked. Once the end of the line failed, the line collapsed, rolled up by Banér, while Horn held firm, pinning them to the front.</p>}

    description{<p>This is a lesser known battle and proved to be a great challenge pulling together the research. Thanks to the help of Knut Grünitz, Dr. Venus of the Museum at Zirndorf, author-historian Peter Engerisser, and Daniel Sodders at the University of Kansas, we pulled together a very accurate map and order of battle. My starting point was the very detailed engravings and order of battle info from the Sveriges Krig (SK). Dr. Guthrie also provided a comprehensive list of regiments, but it did not take long to discover some major inconsistencies on the Swedes deployment and a dearth of information on the Imperials. Engerisser was able to fill in the missing pieces of the Swedish deployment; it turns out the SK was based on a drawing and plan from Gustav Adolf drawn a few days before the actual battle and thus could be used only as a general guideline. During actual deployment, positions changed and brigades were broken down into battalions due to the difficult approach. For the Imperials, we had a good list of Wallenstein’s army, but not all the army was in place for the battle. We had a couple of regiments mentioned by name, but it was only a fraction. Sodders dug up an Imperial casualty list by regiment which filled in the gaps. The Imperial units present are those that took casualties. I based the order of arrival on the number of casualties; the fewer, the later the arrival. While not 100% accurate, it represents an educated guess that is far more than was available before.</p><p>Yes, we know that in modern German “Old Fort” is Alte Feste, but the place name was codified before the spelling was modernized so the place is still known as Alte Veste. The fort was a small castle, dating from the 14th Century, mainly a tower that was completely ruined by the time of the battle. There is a tower at the park today, just north of Zirndorf. The park preserves most of the battlefield, and is still wooded and has many walking trails. The tower adorns the crest of Stadt Zirndorf.</p><p>I wanted to show Gustav Adolf in a variety of different engagements. This one is very different from the set-piece field battles. It also shows Gustav Adolf’s direct and aggressive approach being sharply rebuffed.</p>}

Knut did some digging and was able to put together a very nice map from a variety of sources. I had the benefit of Richard Brzezinski’s excellent book on the battle, which allowed me to do a comprehensive review of the order of battle. For those who played Lion of the North or used the revision in Sweden Fights On: Musket & Mike Battle Series Volume II, you will notice some changes based on this research. Daniel Sodders also helped by reviewing and providing an alternative view to Brzezinski’s Imperial Order of Battle.

While it would be difficult for the four units actually to fly together in formation, they were able to concentrate and overwhelm British formations where they met them in combat. This grouping would be made more official in June 1917 upon formation of Jagdgeschwader Nr I (Jastas 4, 6, 10 and 11) under the leadership of Manfred von Richthofen.

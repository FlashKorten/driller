  <p>In Bulge 20, the Allies don’t know which German strategic objective is being pursued. Allied intelligence work is required to ascertain the real German intentions so as not to overreact to the threat, because this time, the Germans can win if their staff can outthink and outmaneuver the Allies’ staff!</p>

"Combat Commander CCE026 - Turnbull Turns 'em" {
  21050
  <p>It's D-Day, and the 82nd Airborne Division is struggling to consolidate its defenses at St. Mere-Eglise. Expecting a counter-attack from the north, 3/505 Commander Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort orders D Company's 3rd Platoon - led by 1st Lt. Turner Turnbull - to block Route D-15 at Neuville-au-Plain. Shortly after arriving, Turnbull's force of 43 men spot a large column of men in feldgrau approaching down the highway, apparently escorted by soldiers wearing American paratroopers' uniform. Wary of a ruse, an American machine-gunner fires warning shots into a nearby field. The German "prioners" dive for the ditches. After fanning out in either direction in order to try and outflank the outnumbered but well-entrenched Americans, the German attack commences.</p>

"Borodino 20 - Napoleon in Russia 1812" {
  38361
  <p>Designer Lance McMillan marches the Napoleonic 20 game system to the very outskirts of Moscow where a brutal campaign culminates in a titanic battle between the exhausted French Grande Armée and the entrenched Russian Army whose divided and bickering leadership has led them to this fateful moment. In Borodino 20, players can recreate the historical battle and the human foibles of the commanders fighting it. In addition, they can experiment with scenarios presuming a faster Russian response to the French threat, or Napoleon heeding the advice of his “Iron Marshal,” Davout, to try a daring flanking maneuver. Featuring only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and “friction of war” which gives players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!</p>

  <p>The Napoleonic 20 game system expands with France’s long-planned invasion of England finally launched! With only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns providing the operational pauses and “friction of war” that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic campaign as the armies close for battle. With his newly trained and organized Grande Armée, Napoleon masses his forces in Boulogne for the great invasion. The Franco-Spanish fleet arrives on time to seize control of the English Channel, and a hell-for-leather landing is made aimed straight at London – the Kent Campaign ensues! With special post-landing maneuvering and naval conflict abstractions, Albion 20 adds many fascinating new features to simulate this campaign. Will the Emperor finally triumph over his archrival, “Perfidious Albion?” Or will there always be an England?</p>

  <p>Jena 20 is the second title featuring Joseph Miranda’s innovative Napoleonic 20 game system. With only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns providing the operational pauses and “friction of war” that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic campaign as the armies close for battle. Following France’s glorious victory against the combined Austro-Russian armies at Austerlitz the previous December, the Prussians have finally come off the fence and declared war against Napoleon. As both sides maneuver, uncertain of the location or center of gravity of the opposing army, they meet in a dramatic double battle on the fields of both Jena and Auerstadt. Can the heirs of Frederick the Great maintain their composure and cohesion long enough to teach the haughty French a lesson, or will Napoleon and his Marshals ride on to ever greater glory?</p>

  <p>By November, Operation Typhoon is in full swing. The Wehrmacht is at the gates of Moscow. Up North, Klin has fallen and the XXXXth Panzer Korps is rumbling towards the Soviet capital. But the Russians are hanging on somehow, with "General Winter" on their side. On the 27th, the thermometer fell to -40 degrees celsius. For the Germans who thought they'd be in Moscow long before now, Hell has frozen over! Tank tracks are soldered into the frozen mud, weapons are too cold to hold with bare hands, and men are dying in place. The 2nd Panzerdivision manages to reach Lobnia and Kimki, 10 miles from the Kremlin, but can't go any further. The Russians have thrown all they have, including factory workers, to protect Mother Russia. The Germans stop and go on the defensive. Initiative has changed hands...</p>

  <p>By October 1942, Stalingrad had become a matter of personal prestige for both Stalin and Hitler, and the sole focal point of the Campaign in the East, above and beyond any strategic military consideration. In mid-October, the Luftwaffe intensified its efforts agains the remaining Red Army positions holding the west bank. Luftflotte 4 flew 2,000 sorties on 14 October and 600 tons of bombs were dropped by German Stukas. The same day, three infantry divisions and two Panzer divisions, supported by battalions of combat engineers, surrounded the three northern factories. Their attack was directed against the center of the Soviet line. The 14th Panzer pushed forward and broke through. With the Tractor Factory nearly surrounded, the intensity of the attack effectively split the soviet 62nd Army in two. Knowing that the loss of the Tractor Factory would lead to the collapse of the Soviet's right flank, General von Paulus ordered fresh troops forward to dislodge the last Soviet troops entrenched there. At the same time, the German forces in the center began to turn south toward the Red Barricades...</p>

  <p>By the end of August 1942, Army Group South (B) reached the Volga, north of Stalingrad. In a matter of days, 4th Panzer Army, with the 29th Motorized Division in the lead, headed for the river south of the city, effectively trapping Lieutenant General Chuikov and the men and women of the 62nd Army. Stalin's order of July 27 - "Not a step back!" - was no longer just an obligation but a necessity, and its slogan "There is no land behind the Volga!" the harsh reality that now faced all of the city's inhabitants.</p><p>Having witnessed firsthand on the Russian steppe the devastating effectiveness of German Blitzkrieg tactics, Chuikov turned the carpet-bombing of the city to his advantage. Anchoring his defense lines in bombed-out buildings that overlooked strategically important streets and squares, he ordered Soviet troops to "hug the enemy". Always keeping the front lines as close to the Germans as physically possible, often a mere floor or door frame away, he successfully negated much of the Germans' firepower and combined arms superiority. At such a close range, German infantry soon found themselves forced to fight on their own; or risk taking casualties from their own close air and artillery support! Key landmarks, such as the South Railway Station - which changed hands 14 times in 6 hours; and the Grain Elevator - where combat raged for weeks, became part of history. A year later, the city's defenders were collectively recognized for their courage with the gift of a ceremonial broadsword whose etching reads: "To the steel-hearted citizens of Stalingrad - the gift of King George VI - in token of the homage of the British people."</p>

  <p>After a month of heavy fighting, the Germans finally lost Hill 192 the previous night (See "Attack on Hill 192"). For the first time since June they no longer dominate the road to Saint-Lo. Should US High Command be able to deploy the 5th Corps into a large-scale armored offensive, the city will finally be within reach. But the German elite Parachute units have taken advantage of darkness to pull back onto Hill 101 in the vicinity of the Bayeux Highway near la Boulaye, as well as onto Hill 147 on Martinville's Ridge northeast of Saint-Lo. Reinforced by elements of the Panzer Lehr, they have set up a line of defense in te endless cover of fields, woods and streams. Their airpower grounded by poor weather and their tanks mired in unforgiving "bocage" country, the Allies must place the burden of the attack on the shoulders of their infantry yet again. What awaits the weary US troops will forever be known as "Hedgerow Hell"...</p>

"Agrigentum - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  The First Punic War began when Rome decided to invade Sicily in 264. Carthage, unprepared, scrambled to raise an army under Hannibal Gisgo. By 262 Hannibal arrived with an advance force at Agrigentum, but the Roman consuls Lucius Postumius Megellus and Quintus Mamilius Vitulus made a preemptive strike and placed him under siege. Months later, Carthage dispatched a relief army of 30,000 foot, 4,500 horse and 60 elephants under Hanno the Elder. Megellus and Vitulus detached about a quarter of their army to guard Hannibal, and brought the remaining 35,000 foot and 3,000 horse onto the field. Hanno organized his army with the mercenaries in the van, his elephants in a second line and his African levies in a third. As the armies clashed the mercenaries fought fiercely at first, but eventually buckled. As they routed into the line of elephants, all hell broke loose. The elephants were caught up in the pandemonium,and began to rampage in all directions. The third Carthaginian line was thrown into confusion, but rallied to resist the advancing legions. After more hard fighting, the Punic army broke. The largest battle of the First Punic War had ended in a decisive Roman victory, but ironically Hannibal's army was able to escape. Toman losses in the battle and the siege were so heavy that Megellus and Vitulus were denied a triumph, despite their victory.

  Following the defeat at Iliturgi, the Carthaginians made an unsuccessful attempt against Intibili, and then withdrew to the south. Early in the spring (214) they dealt with a major Iberian uprising, crushing the rebel army and re-imposing Punic authority. Many more Roman allies would have defected if Publius Scipio had not hurried south with one legion, about 10,000 men. Scipio camped near Castrum Album, famous as the site of Hamilcar Barca's death fourteen years earlier. Hasdrubal, Mago and Hannibal infiltrated the surrounding area undetected. They brought only fast-moving light infantry and mounted troops. When Publius Scipio advanced from Castrum Album towards his brother Gnaeus' camp, he was beset by Punic skirmishers and Numidian horsemen. The light Carthaginian forces showered the slow moving Roman column with javelins, sling-stones and arrows. Whenever the Romans charged, their opponents melted away. Publius' command was in danger of annihilation, and he just barely cut his way through to the safety of his brother's camp. Over 2,000 Romans were left dead along the route of his march, and many of the survivors were wounded. It was a clear Carthaginian victory. Hasdrubal, however, was unable to exploit the superiority of his Numidians for long, as a major revolt broke out in Africa and many of his elite cavalry deserted. The campaigns of the five armies would continue until both Roman armies were destroyed and both Scipio brothers killed at the battles of Castulo and Ilorca (211).

  <p>Saumur - June 19, 1949. The Battle of France is lost; the Germans are now ready to cross the River Loire. The meager French troops standing ready and lined up to defend it are the Officer Cadets from the Cavalry School at Saumur, reinforced with a Battalion of the Infantry School at St-Maixent and hodgepodge remnants of the French army. At the first sight of the enemy, they blow the bridges. Embarking on rafts, the Germans soon attempt to cross the river on the islands at Gennes and East of Saumur. The cadets, dug-in and with no real option for retreat, resist heroically, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Their valiant efforts are not enough however, and by June 21, the Germans are already breaking through to the South-West. The following day, June 22, 1940, the French army capitulates: The armistice is signed at Rethondes, and takes effect on June 25.</p>

  <p>Adopting the Dyle Plan, the cavalry corps of Gen. Prioux moves into Belgium, ahead of Gen. Blanchard's 1st Army to confront the German invaders. Near Hannut, French scout units find themselves facing incoming fire from frontline German units. From there on, their mission is to hold back or at least delay the Germans - hoping to gain time for the slower Allied corps elements deploying along the Dyle. The two light motorized divisions (DLM) of Gen. Prioux bear the brunt of the assault, facing two formidable Panzer divisions and five supporting infantry divisions. Despite this unequal match of forces, the 2nd and 3rd DLM manage to hold the Germans back for two days, saving the Dyle Plan. On May 14, decimated but their mission accomplished, the DLMs withdraw to the rear.</p>

  <p>The largest airborne operation of all time, Operation Market Garden was a bold attempt by Field Marshal Montgomery to drop three entire Airborne Divisions behind the enemy lines, in German-occupied Netherlands. Their tactical objective: To capture and hold all the major water crossings along a narrow 60-mile stretch of highway and into northern Germany. British XXX Corps would then rush onwards from the Dutch-Belgian border and across the Maas and Lower Rhine to outflank the Siegfried Line and choke off the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland.</p><p>The daylight drops were initially successful, with the capture of the Waal bridge at Nijmegen, but German resistance was stronger than expected; the British 1st Airborne Division failed to secure the bridge at Arnhem. British ground advance was hampered by marshy ground. Eindhoven was eventually captured by a joint Airborne and Armor assault, but British XXX Corps failed to relieve the 1st Airborne Division. Despite the latter's valiant hold out at Arnhem bridge, the planned advance had to be abandoned and Monty wouldn't cross the Rhine until the spring of 1945.</p>

  <p>Hot on the heels of their success in Operatsiya Bagration, Soviet forces struck deep towards the Baltic coast, rapidly severing communications between German Army Group North and what little was left of Army Group Center. By early October 1944, the Soviets were in view of the Baltic Sea, near the port of Memel, definitively cutting off Army Group North from any retreat route through East Prussia.</p><p>Despite Guderian's plea for an evacuation by sea and subsequent redeployment in Central Europe where forces were desperately needed to help stabilize an increasingly dicey situation, Hitler stubbornly refused. Instead, he ordered the 200,000+ German troops to entrench themselves, in the hope of using the Courland Pocket as a springboard for a future offensive.</p><p>Little did the F&uuml;hrer realize that what he insisted on calling a bridgehead (the Kurland-Br&uuml;ckenkopf) would only become a bridge to oblivion for his haplessly trapped German divisions; They would go on to resist six major battles before finally surrendering to Marshal Govorov on May 8, 1945. The majority of the 200,000+ men of Army Group North would be marched into Soviet prison camps to the East, most of them never to return.</p>

  10630
  <p>A raid on the German-occupied coastal town of Dieppe, Operation Jubilee was intended to demonstrate the Allies capacity to seize and hold a major port for a short while. The Canadians sent in just couldn't imagine how short their stay would be...</p><p>The landing beach was a mile long, with headlands at both ends and barbed wire across its entire length. At first, enemy fire was light, letting the landing troops - Essex Scottish Regiment on Red Beach and the Hamilton Light Infantry on White Beach - make it through a first row of wire and toward the sea wall with only minor losses. But tanks from the 14th Canadian Tank Batallion had not arrived ahead of the infantry landings as planned; and once landed, they could not get any traction on the loose beach pebbles. To make things worse, the men of the Royal Regiment landing on Blue Beach near Puys arrived late. They were pinned on the beach, unable to move west and take the eastern headlands before the main assault. The Germans, now on full alert, swept the exposed Canadian forces. Control of the Casino and surrounding pillboxes sea-sawed back and forth but to no avail. Four hours after landing, the Allied commanders were forced to call a retreat, leaving almost 60% of the men who'd landed killed, wounded or captured! The lessons learned from this debacle were painful, but were of considerable help in preparations for the landings in Normandy, two years later.</p>

  <p>After smashing British defenses at Gazala, Rommel pushed his Afrika Korps towards Tobruk. Having successfully withstood a 9-months siege the previous year, the city was left to the protection of the 2nd South African Division's General Klopper. The city's defense perimeter consisted of 30 miles of wire entanglements, minefields and prepared infantry positions. In support were a limited number of tanks and artillery.</p><p>Rommel's attack from the South East came on the 20th. Under cover of a morning mist, German engineer units crept forward, clearing mines and wires. Once the mist cleared, the British saw a mass of troops and vehicles approaching. A horrific artillery bombardment followed by a wave of bombers left no doubt the battle had begun. The German Panzers and infantry rolled forward through the wire and minefields. A valiant British armor counter-attack with artillery support briefly halted the advance but by noon the Germans had reorganized and resumed their advance. Once the line at Kings Cross fell, the way to Tobruk lay open and the British command structure disintegrated. Klopper ordered the white flag to be raised...</p>

"Memoir '44 1/5142 - Counter-Attack of the BEF" {
  10630
  <p>France, May 1940 - With the first of Guderian's Panzers reaching the English Channel near Noyelles-sur-Mer, the Allied forces find themselves cut in two. The situation soon becomes untenable. Thankfully, Lord Gort's British Expeditionary Force (BEF) has withdrawn from Belgium and is now in the vicinity of Lille. He orders General Francklin, commander og the 50th Infantry Division,j to lead a counter-attack. He splits his forces in two: on the left, the 4th Royal Tank Regiment and the 6th Durham Light Infantry; on the right, the 7th RTR and the 8th DLI, now providing the "Franckforce" its backbone. The French of the 3rd DLM (3rd Mechanized Light Division) provide cover on its right flank.</p><p>The British armored columns circumvent Arras by the South, taking Rommel's 7th Panzer "Phantom" Division by surprise. Panicked, the motorcycles of 7th Kradsch&uuml;tzen Rgt make a hasty retreat; the German anti-tank guns find themselves powerless against the heavily armored Matildas, and are soon crushed. But Rommel's personality saves the day: he orders his campaign artillery and flak to score direct hits on the British tanks. Then, with evening fast approaching, the Luftwaffe puts a decisive end to the Allied counter-attack. During the night of May 21-22, the BEF falls back on its initial position. Lord Gort is now left with a single option - ordering evacuation of the BEF by sea, at Dunkirk.</p>

"Memoir '44 2/4643 - Battle of Abbeville" {
  10630
<p>France, May 1940 - The Allied High Command has already ordered several counter-attacks against the German bridgehead on the Somme river to the south of Abbeville; alas they have all failed. After the defeat of the British 1st Armoured Division, it is the 4th French Armored Division (4th DCR) of De Gaulle, recently promoted to temporary General, that is called to action. With all the might of its 150 armored vehicles, including 30 B1-bis heavy tanks and 3 infantry battalions supplemented by the 22nd RIC on load from a neighboring division, the 4th DCR hammers the positions of the 57th Infantry Division on the bridgehead.</p><p>On May 28, the French seize Huppy and progress toward the Somme, crushing the German anti-tank guns which are ill-equipped to pierce the heavy armor of the B1-bis. On the German side, chaos ensues and troops start withdrawing toward Abbeville. Evening falls and the French, not realizing the scope of their success, fail to press their advantage further. On the 29th, the French renew their push, primarily toward Mont de Caubert. But the German troops dug-in on these heights use their Flak 88 guns to repel any advance, destroying several heavy tanks, and managing to hold the line. By the end of the day, the opportunity to push the Germans back behind the Somme has vanished. On the 30th, the French launch one final attack against Mont de Caubert, where they face a reinvigorated opponent. By the 31st, they are spent and replaced by the 51st "Highland Division". Abbeville is still in German hands.</p>

Shortly thereafter, the 8th Brigade Group of the 3rd British Division, supported by Commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade and the amphibious Sherman tanks of the 13th and 18th Hussars, land on Sword beach.

Around 16:00 the Division's Kampfgruppen lead the charge. KG Rauch reaches the coast between Luc-sur-Mer and Lion-sur-Mer and cordones off the Brits on Sword Beach from their Canadian brethren on Juno. But the spectacular arrival of hundreds of British gliders over St Aubin d'Arquenay puts a stop to the Germans, who are soon forced to retreat back to Caen.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the departure of two armored divisions hastily sent west to counter the 1st US Army's Operation Cobra, Montgomery sends the 2nd British Army to the assault of the Virois bocage in Operation Bluecoat. Their first objectives are two heights to the east of Saint-Martin-des-Besaces: Hill 226 and Hill 309. On July 30, the German front lines, held by the 276 and 326 Infantry Divisions who were entrenched behind minefields, are bombarded and then eviscerated by the assault of the 15th "Scottish Division" and 43rd "Wessex Division" along with support from the "Crocodile" flame thrower tanks of the 141st RAC.</p><p>Following the breach made by the British infantry, the tanks of the Guard Armoured Brigade rumble forward toward their objectives. But a surprise setback soon comes with the appearance on the battlefield of the "Jagdpanthers" of the 654th sPzjg Abr, soon followed by the "Tiger II" tanks of the 503rd sPz Abt and a Kampfgruppe of the 21st Panzerdivision. During the day of July 31, the "Guards" lose many Churchill tanks from the repeated blows of the German heavy armor, but manage to hold their ground on the positions conquered earlier. Operation Bluecoat is now ready to move to its second phase - the capture of Mont-Pincon.</p>

The Germans struggle to regroup 150 tanks from the remnants of four armored divisions before venturing into hedgerow country on the night of August 6-7. Initially they make good progress, except around Saint Barthelemy and Hill 317 near Mortain. But soon the fog lifts, unveiling a sky full of rocket-equipped Typhoons from the 2nd Tactical Air Force. The Panzer assault is stopped dead in its tracks. For the next 4 days, it's a duel to the last between the US Infantry and the German Panzers. Finally on August 12, Von Kluge is forced to call the retreat. The ultimate attempt to save Normandy has failed.</p>

While motorized units are able to breakthrough and escape quickly, the same cannot be said for those on foot.</p><p>Marschgruppe S&uuml;d, under the command of General Elster, is the last one to depart; its soldiers find themselves constantly harassed by French Resistance fighters and the relentless strafing and bombardments of Allied warplanes that dominate the air.

Fog and snow have hampered the action and the beleaguered Americans can only tell what is happening from up real close. Allied Command has told them to withdraw to Foy, but with the fog, the sound of gunfire seems to swirl around them from every direction. Can the column make it to Foy, not to even mention Bastogne?</p>

Heading North toward the heart of the Reich, the Canadian tanks and Polish artillery of 2nd Corps are making slow progress in the face of increasingly desperate German troops. Massive carpet-bombing could pave the way, but might break the dykes and flood the low-lying countryside. Queen Wilhelmina has successfully begged it off, in an effort to spare the civilian population.</p><p>So on the night of April 7, despite terrible weather, two sticks of French SAS - some 676 men from the 2nd and 3rd French Regiments de Chasseurs Parachutistes - jump behind the enemy lines, in the Drenthe province.

By April 9th lead elements of 2ns Corps' make contact with the French but it is only with the help and courage of the local population that total control is finally achieved two weeks later.</p>

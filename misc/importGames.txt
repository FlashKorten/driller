  <p>In Bulge 20, the Allies don’t know which German strategic objective is being pursued. Allied intelligence work is required to ascertain the real German intentions so as not to overreact to the threat, because this time, the Germans can win if their staff can outthink and outmaneuver the Allies’ staff!</p>

"Combat Commander CCE026 - Turnbull Turns 'em" {
  21050
  <p>It's D-Day, and the 82nd Airborne Division is struggling to consolidate its defenses at St. Mere-Eglise. Expecting a counter-attack from the north, 3/505 Commander Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort orders D Company's 3rd Platoon - led by 1st Lt. Turner Turnbull - to block Route D-15 at Neuville-au-Plain. Shortly after arriving, Turnbull's force of 43 men spot a large column of men in feldgrau approaching down the highway, apparently escorted by soldiers wearing American paratroopers' uniform. Wary of a ruse, an American machine-gunner fires warning shots into a nearby field. The German "prioners" dive for the ditches. After fanning out in either direction in order to try and outflank the outnumbered but well-entrenched Americans, the German attack commences.</p>

"Borodino 20 - Napoleon in Russia 1812" {
  38361
  <p>Designer Lance McMillan marches the Napoleonic 20 game system to the very outskirts of Moscow where a brutal campaign culminates in a titanic battle between the exhausted French Grande Armée and the entrenched Russian Army whose divided and bickering leadership has led them to this fateful moment. In Borodino 20, players can recreate the historical battle and the human foibles of the commanders fighting it. In addition, they can experiment with scenarios presuming a faster Russian response to the French threat, or Napoleon heeding the advice of his “Iron Marshal,” Davout, to try a daring flanking maneuver. Featuring only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and “friction of war” which gives players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!</p>

  <p>The Napoleonic 20 game system expands with France’s long-planned invasion of England finally launched! With only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns providing the operational pauses and “friction of war” that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic campaign as the armies close for battle. With his newly trained and organized Grande Armée, Napoleon masses his forces in Boulogne for the great invasion. The Franco-Spanish fleet arrives on time to seize control of the English Channel, and a hell-for-leather landing is made aimed straight at London – the Kent Campaign ensues! With special post-landing maneuvering and naval conflict abstractions, Albion 20 adds many fascinating new features to simulate this campaign. Will the Emperor finally triumph over his archrival, “Perfidious Albion?” Or will there always be an England?</p>

  <p>Jena 20 is the second title featuring Joseph Miranda’s innovative Napoleonic 20 game system. With only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns providing the operational pauses and “friction of war” that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic campaign as the armies close for battle. Following France’s glorious victory against the combined Austro-Russian armies at Austerlitz the previous December, the Prussians have finally come off the fence and declared war against Napoleon. As both sides maneuver, uncertain of the location or center of gravity of the opposing army, they meet in a dramatic double battle on the fields of both Jena and Auerstadt. Can the heirs of Frederick the Great maintain their composure and cohesion long enough to teach the haughty French a lesson, or will Napoleon and his Marshals ride on to ever greater glory?</p>

  <p>By November, Operation Typhoon is in full swing. The Wehrmacht is at the gates of Moscow. Up North, Klin has fallen and the XXXXth Panzer Korps is rumbling towards the Soviet capital. But the Russians are hanging on somehow, with "General Winter" on their side. On the 27th, the thermometer fell to -40 degrees celsius. For the Germans who thought they'd be in Moscow long before now, Hell has frozen over! Tank tracks are soldered into the frozen mud, weapons are too cold to hold with bare hands, and men are dying in place. The 2nd Panzerdivision manages to reach Lobnia and Kimki, 10 miles from the Kremlin, but can't go any further. The Russians have thrown all they have, including factory workers, to protect Mother Russia. The Germans stop and go on the defensive. Initiative has changed hands...</p>

  <p>By October 1942, Stalingrad had become a matter of personal prestige for both Stalin and Hitler, and the sole focal point of the Campaign in the East, above and beyond any strategic military consideration. In mid-October, the Luftwaffe intensified its efforts agains the remaining Red Army positions holding the west bank. Luftflotte 4 flew 2,000 sorties on 14 October and 600 tons of bombs were dropped by German Stukas. The same day, three infantry divisions and two Panzer divisions, supported by battalions of combat engineers, surrounded the three northern factories. Their attack was directed against the center of the Soviet line. The 14th Panzer pushed forward and broke through. With the Tractor Factory nearly surrounded, the intensity of the attack effectively split the soviet 62nd Army in two. Knowing that the loss of the Tractor Factory would lead to the collapse of the Soviet's right flank, General von Paulus ordered fresh troops forward to dislodge the last Soviet troops entrenched there. At the same time, the German forces in the center began to turn south toward the Red Barricades...</p>

  <p>By the end of August 1942, Army Group South (B) reached the Volga, north of Stalingrad. In a matter of days, 4th Panzer Army, with the 29th Motorized Division in the lead, headed for the river south of the city, effectively trapping Lieutenant General Chuikov and the men and women of the 62nd Army. Stalin's order of July 27 - "Not a step back!" - was no longer just an obligation but a necessity, and its slogan "There is no land behind the Volga!" the harsh reality that now faced all of the city's inhabitants.</p><p>Having witnessed firsthand on the Russian steppe the devastating effectiveness of German Blitzkrieg tactics, Chuikov turned the carpet-bombing of the city to his advantage. Anchoring his defense lines in bombed-out buildings that overlooked strategically important streets and squares, he ordered Soviet troops to "hug the enemy". Always keeping the front lines as close to the Germans as physically possible, often a mere floor or door frame away, he successfully negated much of the Germans' firepower and combined arms superiority. At such a close range, German infantry soon found themselves forced to fight on their own; or risk taking casualties from their own close air and artillery support! Key landmarks, such as the South Railway Station - which changed hands 14 times in 6 hours; and the Grain Elevator - where combat raged for weeks, became part of history. A year later, the city's defenders were collectively recognized for their courage with the gift of a ceremonial broadsword whose etching reads: "To the steel-hearted citizens of Stalingrad - the gift of King George VI - in token of the homage of the British people."</p>

  <p>After a month of heavy fighting, the Germans finally lost Hill 192 the previous night (See "Attack on Hill 192"). For the first time since June they no longer dominate the road to Saint-Lo. Should US High Command be able to deploy the 5th Corps into a large-scale armored offensive, the city will finally be within reach. But the German elite Parachute units have taken advantage of darkness to pull back onto Hill 101 in the vicinity of the Bayeux Highway near la Boulaye, as well as onto Hill 147 on Martinville's Ridge northeast of Saint-Lo. Reinforced by elements of the Panzer Lehr, they have set up a line of defense in te endless cover of fields, woods and streams. Their airpower grounded by poor weather and their tanks mired in unforgiving "bocage" country, the Allies must place the burden of the attack on the shoulders of their infantry yet again. What awaits the weary US troops will forever be known as "Hedgerow Hell"...</p>

"Agrigentum - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  The First Punic War began when Rome decided to invade Sicily in 264. Carthage, unprepared, scrambled to raise an army under Hannibal Gisgo. By 262 Hannibal arrived with an advance force at Agrigentum, but the Roman consuls Lucius Postumius Megellus and Quintus Mamilius Vitulus made a preemptive strike and placed him under siege. Months later, Carthage dispatched a relief army of 30,000 foot, 4,500 horse and 60 elephants under Hanno the Elder. Megellus and Vitulus detached about a quarter of their army to guard Hannibal, and brought the remaining 35,000 foot and 3,000 horse onto the field. Hanno organized his army with the mercenaries in the van, his elephants in a second line and his African levies in a third. As the armies clashed the mercenaries fought fiercely at first, but eventually buckled. As they routed into the line of elephants, all hell broke loose. The elephants were caught up in the pandemonium,and began to rampage in all directions. The third Carthaginian line was thrown into confusion, but rallied to resist the advancing legions. After more hard fighting, the Punic army broke. The largest battle of the First Punic War had ended in a decisive Roman victory, but ironically Hannibal's army was able to escape. Toman losses in the battle and the siege were so heavy that Megellus and Vitulus were denied a triumph, despite their victory.

  Following the defeat at Iliturgi, the Carthaginians made an unsuccessful attempt against Intibili, and then withdrew to the south. Early in the spring (214) they dealt with a major Iberian uprising, crushing the rebel army and re-imposing Punic authority. Many more Roman allies would have defected if Publius Scipio had not hurried south with one legion, about 10,000 men. Scipio camped near Castrum Album, famous as the site of Hamilcar Barca's death fourteen years earlier. Hasdrubal, Mago and Hannibal infiltrated the surrounding area undetected. They brought only fast-moving light infantry and mounted troops. When Publius Scipio advanced from Castrum Album towards his brother Gnaeus' camp, he was beset by Punic skirmishers and Numidian horsemen. The light Carthaginian forces showered the slow moving Roman column with javelins, sling-stones and arrows. Whenever the Romans charged, their opponents melted away. Publius' command was in danger of annihilation, and he just barely cut his way through to the safety of his brother's camp. Over 2,000 Romans were left dead along the route of his march, and many of the survivors were wounded. It was a clear Carthaginian victory. Hasdrubal, however, was unable to exploit the superiority of his Numidians for long, as a major revolt broke out in Africa and many of his elite cavalry deserted. The campaigns of the five armies would continue until both Roman armies were destroyed and both Scipio brothers killed at the battles of Castulo and Ilorca (211).

  <p>Saumur - June 19, 1949. The Battle of France is lost; the Germans are now ready to cross the River Loire. The meager French troops standing ready and lined up to defend it are the Officer Cadets from the Cavalry School at Saumur, reinforced with a Battalion of the Infantry School at St-Maixent and hodgepodge remnants of the French army. At the first sight of the enemy, they blow the bridges. Embarking on rafts, the Germans soon attempt to cross the river on the islands at Gennes and East of Saumur. The cadets, dug-in and with no real option for retreat, resist heroically, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Their valiant efforts are not enough however, and by June 21, the Germans are already breaking through to the South-West. The following day, June 22, 1940, the French army capitulates: The armistice is signed at Rethondes, and takes effect on June 25.</p>

  <p>Adopting the Dyle Plan, the cavalry corps of Gen. Prioux moves into Belgium, ahead of Gen. Blanchard's 1st Army to confront the German invaders. Near Hannut, French scout units find themselves facing incoming fire from frontline German units. From there on, their mission is to hold back or at least delay the Germans - hoping to gain time for the slower Allied corps elements deploying along the Dyle. The two light motorized divisions (DLM) of Gen. Prioux bear the brunt of the assault, facing two formidable Panzer divisions and five supporting infantry divisions. Despite this unequal match of forces, the 2nd and 3rd DLM manage to hold the Germans back for two days, saving the Dyle Plan. On May 14, decimated but their mission accomplished, the DLMs withdraw to the rear.</p>

  <p>The largest airborne operation of all time, Operation Market Garden was a bold attempt by Field Marshal Montgomery to drop three entire Airborne Divisions behind the enemy lines, in German-occupied Netherlands. Their tactical objective: To capture and hold all the major water crossings along a narrow 60-mile stretch of highway and into northern Germany. British XXX Corps would then rush onwards from the Dutch-Belgian border and across the Maas and Lower Rhine to outflank the Siegfried Line and choke off the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland.</p><p>The daylight drops were initially successful, with the capture of the Waal bridge at Nijmegen, but German resistance was stronger than expected; the British 1st Airborne Division failed to secure the bridge at Arnhem. British ground advance was hampered by marshy ground. Eindhoven was eventually captured by a joint Airborne and Armor assault, but British XXX Corps failed to relieve the 1st Airborne Division. Despite the latter's valiant hold out at Arnhem bridge, the planned advance had to be abandoned and Monty wouldn't cross the Rhine until the spring of 1945.</p>

  <p>Hot on the heels of their success in Operatsiya Bagration, Soviet forces struck deep towards the Baltic coast, rapidly severing communications between German Army Group North and what little was left of Army Group Center. By early October 1944, the Soviets were in view of the Baltic Sea, near the port of Memel, definitively cutting off Army Group North from any retreat route through East Prussia.</p><p>Despite Guderian's plea for an evacuation by sea and subsequent redeployment in Central Europe where forces were desperately needed to help stabilize an increasingly dicey situation, Hitler stubbornly refused. Instead, he ordered the 200,000+ German troops to entrench themselves, in the hope of using the Courland Pocket as a springboard for a future offensive.</p><p>Little did the F&uuml;hrer realize that what he insisted on calling a bridgehead (the Kurland-Br&uuml;ckenkopf) would only become a bridge to oblivion for his haplessly trapped German divisions; They would go on to resist six major battles before finally surrendering to Marshal Govorov on May 8, 1945. The majority of the 200,000+ men of Army Group North would be marched into Soviet prison camps to the East, most of them never to return.</p>

  10630
  <p>A raid on the German-occupied coastal town of Dieppe, Operation Jubilee was intended to demonstrate the Allies capacity to seize and hold a major port for a short while. The Canadians sent in just couldn't imagine how short their stay would be...</p><p>The landing beach was a mile long, with headlands at both ends and barbed wire across its entire length. At first, enemy fire was light, letting the landing troops - Essex Scottish Regiment on Red Beach and the Hamilton Light Infantry on White Beach - make it through a first row of wire and toward the sea wall with only minor losses. But tanks from the 14th Canadian Tank Batallion had not arrived ahead of the infantry landings as planned; and once landed, they could not get any traction on the loose beach pebbles. To make things worse, the men of the Royal Regiment landing on Blue Beach near Puys arrived late. They were pinned on the beach, unable to move west and take the eastern headlands before the main assault. The Germans, now on full alert, swept the exposed Canadian forces. Control of the Casino and surrounding pillboxes sea-sawed back and forth but to no avail. Four hours after landing, the Allied commanders were forced to call a retreat, leaving almost 60% of the men who'd landed killed, wounded or captured! The lessons learned from this debacle were painful, but were of considerable help in preparations for the landings in Normandy, two years later.</p>

  <p>After smashing British defenses at Gazala, Rommel pushed his Afrika Korps towards Tobruk. Having successfully withstood a 9-months siege the previous year, the city was left to the protection of the 2nd South African Division's General Klopper. The city's defense perimeter consisted of 30 miles of wire entanglements, minefields and prepared infantry positions. In support were a limited number of tanks and artillery.</p><p>Rommel's attack from the South East came on the 20th. Under cover of a morning mist, German engineer units crept forward, clearing mines and wires. Once the mist cleared, the British saw a mass of troops and vehicles approaching. A horrific artillery bombardment followed by a wave of bombers left no doubt the battle had begun. The German Panzers and infantry rolled forward through the wire and minefields. A valiant British armor counter-attack with artillery support briefly halted the advance but by noon the Germans had reorganized and resumed their advance. Once the line at Kings Cross fell, the way to Tobruk lay open and the British command structure disintegrated. Klopper ordered the white flag to be raised...</p>

"Memoir '44 1/5142 - Counter-Attack of the BEF" {
  10630
  <p>France, May 1940 - With the first of Guderian's Panzers reaching the English Channel near Noyelles-sur-Mer, the Allied forces find themselves cut in two. The situation soon becomes untenable. Thankfully, Lord Gort's British Expeditionary Force (BEF) has withdrawn from Belgium and is now in the vicinity of Lille. He orders General Francklin, commander og the 50th Infantry Division,j to lead a counter-attack. He splits his forces in two: on the left, the 4th Royal Tank Regiment and the 6th Durham Light Infantry; on the right, the 7th RTR and the 8th DLI, now providing the "Franckforce" its backbone. The French of the 3rd DLM (3rd Mechanized Light Division) provide cover on its right flank.</p><p>The British armored columns circumvent Arras by the South, taking Rommel's 7th Panzer "Phantom" Division by surprise. Panicked, the motorcycles of 7th Kradsch&uuml;tzen Rgt make a hasty retreat; the German anti-tank guns find themselves powerless against the heavily armored Matildas, and are soon crushed. But Rommel's personality saves the day: he orders his campaign artillery and flak to score direct hits on the British tanks. Then, with evening fast approaching, the Luftwaffe puts a decisive end to the Allied counter-attack. During the night of May 21-22, the BEF falls back on its initial position. Lord Gort is now left with a single option - ordering evacuation of the BEF by sea, at Dunkirk.</p>

"Memoir '44 2/4643 - Battle of Abbeville" {
  10630
<p>France, May 1940 - The Allied High Command has already ordered several counter-attacks against the German bridgehead on the Somme river to the south of Abbeville; alas they have all failed. After the defeat of the British 1st Armoured Division, it is the 4th French Armored Division (4th DCR) of De Gaulle, recently promoted to temporary General, that is called to action. With all the might of its 150 armored vehicles, including 30 B1-bis heavy tanks and 3 infantry battalions supplemented by the 22nd RIC on load from a neighboring division, the 4th DCR hammers the positions of the 57th Infantry Division on the bridgehead.</p><p>On May 28, the French seize Huppy and progress toward the Somme, crushing the German anti-tank guns which are ill-equipped to pierce the heavy armor of the B1-bis. On the German side, chaos ensues and troops start withdrawing toward Abbeville. Evening falls and the French, not realizing the scope of their success, fail to press their advantage further. On the 29th, the French renew their push, primarily toward Mont de Caubert. But the German troops dug-in on these heights use their Flak 88 guns to repel any advance, destroying several heavy tanks, and managing to hold the line. By the end of the day, the opportunity to push the Germans back behind the Somme has vanished. On the 30th, the French launch one final attack against Mont de Caubert, where they face a reinvigorated opponent. By the 31st, they are spent and replaced by the 51st "Highland Division". Abbeville is still in German hands.</p>

Shortly thereafter, the 8th Brigade Group of the 3rd British Division, supported by Commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade and the amphibious Sherman tanks of the 13th and 18th Hussars, land on Sword beach.

Around 16:00 the Division's Kampfgruppen lead the charge. KG Rauch reaches the coast between Luc-sur-Mer and Lion-sur-Mer and cordones off the Brits on Sword Beach from their Canadian brethren on Juno. But the spectacular arrival of hundreds of British gliders over St Aubin d'Arquenay puts a stop to the Germans, who are soon forced to retreat back to Caen.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the departure of two armored divisions hastily sent west to counter the 1st US Army's Operation Cobra, Montgomery sends the 2nd British Army to the assault of the Virois bocage in Operation Bluecoat. Their first objectives are two heights to the east of Saint-Martin-des-Besaces: Hill 226 and Hill 309. On July 30, the German front lines, held by the 276 and 326 Infantry Divisions who were entrenched behind minefields, are bombarded and then eviscerated by the assault of the 15th "Scottish Division" and 43rd "Wessex Division" along with support from the "Crocodile" flame thrower tanks of the 141st RAC.</p><p>Following the breach made by the British infantry, the tanks of the Guard Armoured Brigade rumble forward toward their objectives. But a surprise setback soon comes with the appearance on the battlefield of the "Jagdpanthers" of the 654th sPzjg Abr, soon followed by the "Tiger II" tanks of the 503rd sPz Abt and a Kampfgruppe of the 21st Panzerdivision. During the day of July 31, the "Guards" lose many Churchill tanks from the repeated blows of the German heavy armor, but manage to hold their ground on the positions conquered earlier. Operation Bluecoat is now ready to move to its second phase - the capture of Mont-Pincon.</p>

The Germans struggle to regroup 150 tanks from the remnants of four armored divisions before venturing into hedgerow country on the night of August 6-7. Initially they make good progress, except around Saint Barthelemy and Hill 317 near Mortain. But soon the fog lifts, unveiling a sky full of rocket-equipped Typhoons from the 2nd Tactical Air Force. The Panzer assault is stopped dead in its tracks. For the next 4 days, it's a duel to the last between the US Infantry and the German Panzers. Finally on August 12, Von Kluge is forced to call the retreat. The ultimate attempt to save Normandy has failed.</p>

While motorized units are able to breakthrough and escape quickly, the same cannot be said for those on foot.</p><p>Marschgruppe S&uuml;d, under the command of General Elster, is the last one to depart; its soldiers find themselves constantly harassed by French Resistance fighters and the relentless strafing and bombardments of Allied warplanes that dominate the air.

Fog and snow have hampered the action and the beleaguered Americans can only tell what is happening from up real close. Allied Command has told them to withdraw to Foy, but with the fog, the sound of gunfire seems to swirl around them from every direction. Can the column make it to Foy, not to even mention Bastogne?</p>

Heading North toward the heart of the Reich, the Canadian tanks and Polish artillery of 2nd Corps are making slow progress in the face of increasingly desperate German troops. Massive carpet-bombing could pave the way, but might break the dykes and flood the low-lying countryside. Queen Wilhelmina has successfully begged it off, in an effort to spare the civilian population.</p><p>So on the night of April 7, despite terrible weather, two sticks of French SAS - some 676 men from the 2nd and 3rd French Regiments de Chasseurs Parachutistes - jump behind the enemy lines, in the Drenthe province.

By April 9th lead elements of 2ns Corps' make contact with the French but it is only with the help and courage of the local population that total control is finally achieved two weeks later.</p>

"Combat Commander CCP A - Grassy Knoll" {
  28181
  <p>Mindanao Island, Philippines, 7 May 1945&mdash;After capturing Libby Airfield with the aid of Filipino guerrillas, the US 24th Infantry Division found the assault toward Davao becoming exceedingly slow and ponderous. Exacerbating the issue was the preponderance of hemp fields in the area, now very much overgrown with disuse. Traversing these unkempt fields was slow going at best. Japanese forces of the 100th Division, however, found these numerous plantations extremely useful for hiding defensive strongpoints. Guerrillas continued to aid the Americans in their push toward Davao, and in one particularly nasty firefight on the 7th of May actually proved decisive in overcoming a Japanese bunker that was covering a major trail break through the area.</p>

  <p>Northern Burma, 28 June 1944&mdash;Over the course of three weeks in June, Michael "Mad Mike" Calvert's 77th (Chindit) Brigade took Mogaung in support of the US advance down the Hukawng Valley. They suffered 50% casualties. Fearing they would be ordered to join in the siege of Myitkyina, Calvert shut down his radios and began marching towards Stilwell's Army HQ in Kamaing. Along the way, scouts were surprised to discover a ragged - and apparently lost - column of Japanese troops advancing down a jungle path. Calvert ordered his weary survivors into ambush formations around a small village where their road and the enemy trail intersected.</p>

  <p>Ilu River, Guadalcanal, 21 August 1942&mdash;Japanese HQ dispatched the Ichiki Detachment from Truk to displace what was mistakenly thought of as a minor US presence on Guadalcanal. During what is known as the Battle of Tenaru River, by 0030, Colonel Ichiki had maneuvered his force into position and ordered some covering fire across the river. Since minor patrols with small enemy parties were a nightly occurence, the fire did not raise significant alarm among the defenders. At 0200 Ichiki ordered 2nd company of the Japanese II/28th Regiment to charge across the sandbar of the Ilu River (known as Alligator Creek to the US Marines). The goal was to push past the defensive perimeter and on to Henderson Field. Facing them were the US Marines of G Company of the II/1st Regiment and two platoons of the 1st Special Weapons Battalion. The shrieking attackers came across the river without cease, but the defenders held their nerve and their ground.</p>

Empress Augusta Bay had been chosen because it was within range of allied land-based fighter bases and because the Japanese 17th Army was concentrated at other sites around the island. The stretch of beach near Cape Torokina was only "lightly" defended by little more than a company of well-camouflaged Japanese infantry&mdash;including a 75mm gun dug-in on the cape that wreaked havoc amongst the landing craft on their long approach to the beach in heavy seas.</p>

"Iliturgi - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Following the decisive victory of the Scipio brothers at Dertosa (215), Carthage sent out 13,500 reinforcements for Hasdrubal Barca under his brother Mago. Hasdrubal reorganized his command of 18,000 men into three small armies, one under his command, one led by Mago and the third under Hannibal, son of Bomilcar. Once the Romans had retired north of the Ebro River for the winter, the Carthaginians struck back in late autumn (215) and besieged Iliturgi, a Roman garrisoned city. Each Punic commander set up a separate camp around the city. The citizens of Iliturgi and their Roman garrison soon suffered from hunger, as they had been caught unprepared. Gnaeus and Publius Scipio marched to the scene with two legions, about 18,000 troops, to lift the siege. Upon arriving, the Scipios decided to assault Hasdrubal's camp first, as it was the largest and the key to breaking the siege. As the assault on Hasdrubal's camp climaxed, the armies of Mago and Hamilcar arrived and the fighting spread out and intensified. Ultimately, the Romans emerged victorious, overrunning the camp and breaking the siege. However, the casualties were probably about equal on both sides. Since Rome was hard-pressed by Hannibal in Italy, the Carthaginians could more easily replace their losses, and benefited from such battles of attrition. On the other hand, Carthage needed a decisive victory before reinforcements could be sent to Hannibal in Italy. The campaigns of these five armies continued for another four years.</p>

"Cissa - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>As the Second Punic War began (218 BC), Hannibal first conquered northern Spain. Before heading to Italy, he left his brother Hasdrubal with about 15,000 men in southern Spain and Hanno with 11,000 men in the north. The consul Publius Scipio had been assigned an army of 24,000 with which to invade Spain and defeat Hannibal. However, when Scipio arrived in Massilia, he was shocked to discover Hannibal's army was headed to the Alps. Publius returned to defend Italy, but he sent his army on to Spain under his elder brother Gnaeus. The Romans were not expected so late in the year, and quickly overran northern Spain and then advanced on Hanno's camp at Cissa. Hanno had been reinforced with a few thousand Illergete warriors under Indibilis. Although still heavily outnumbered, Hanno decided to occupy a strong position on high ground rather than retreat to join Hasdrubal. Gnaeus Scipio did not hesitate and charged his army up the heights in a frontal assault. The fighting was brutal, but the outnumbered Carthaginians were eventually driven off the heights in flight. Reportedly, Carthage lost 6,000 killed and 2,000 captured, including both Hanno and Indibilis. Despite suffering heavy losses, the Romans had the victory. The Romans had established a foothold in Spain. Indibilis was later released, an act of clemency Gnaeus Scipio soon came to regret. Publius finally arrived a year later, bringing a third legion of 8,000 reinforcements. Each of the Scipio brothers could now command his own army in Spain.</p>

"Caralis - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Sardinia had been a Carthaginian province for centuries until the turmoil of the Truceless War (241-238) allowed Rome to opportunistically seize the island. This incident fed the hatred of Hamilcar Barca and his sons for Rome. While Hannibal was crossing the Alps to invade Italy, the agent Hanno slipped onto the island to foment a tribal rebellion. After Hannibal's great victory at Cannae, Hanno instigated an island-wide uprising under King Hampsicora and sent messengers to Carthage for support to capture the weakly garrisoned island. An expedition under Hasdrubal the Bald was delayed by a storm. While Hasdrubal was re-fitting his fleet, the Romans scraped up a reinforcing legion under the septuagenarian noble Titus Manlius Torquatus, who was already on the island when Hasdrubal finally arrived. The two armies met near Caralis. Hasdrubal, with about 20,000 men and 20 elephants, posted his Sards on one wing and his African and Balearic expeditionary forces on the other. Torquatus grounded his fleet and pressed his sailors into service to swell his ranks to 22,000 foot and 1200 horse. The fighting was fierce and prolonged. Eventually, the Sard wing collapsed and Hanno's African wing, which had been fighting well, was taken in the flank and also routed. Reports said 12,000 Sardinians and Carthaginians were slain and about 3700 men, including Hasdrubal and Hanno, were taken captive. Hampsicora commited suicide when he learned that his son Hostus had been killed in the fighting. Sardinia would remain in Roman hands.</p>

"Himeras River - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Western Sicily had been a Carthaginian province for centuries, until Rome captured it in the First Punic War. Hannibal sent an agent, Epicydes, to Syracuse to lead a rebellion agains Rome in 214. Rome responded by sending M. Claudius Marcellus against the city. Marcellus succeeded in taking Syracuse but the Sicilian campaign was not yet over. Epicydes rallied the remnants of the Carthaginian and Greek armies at Agrigentum and Hanno arrived from Africa with a new army, including 3000 Numidian cavalry. Hannibal also sent one of his crack cavalry commanders, the Liby-Phoenician Muttines, who was soon dashing all over Sicily with the Numidians. The three Punic commanders built their army up to 20,000 foot and 3500 horse, but Hanno, jealous of Muttines' success, ordered him to not march with the army. Marcellus marched against them with about 24,000 foot and 2000 horse. At this point, 10 Numidian deserters rode to the Roman camp and informed Marcellus that their countrymen were furious at the insult to Muttines and intended to take no part in the battle. Hoping the news was true, but expecting a trap, Marcellus led his legions out to face the Punic army. As the Libyan and Greek infantry advanced into the fray, it became apparent that the Numidians were holding back. Marcellus ordered the Roman horse to turn the exposed Punic flank. When the Numidians did not respond, the Punic infantry became demoralized and broke. Marcellus had the victory.</p>

"Umbria - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Even as one Roman army under Flaminius was being butchered by Hannibal's troops at Lake Trasimenus in 217 BC, his colleague Gnaeus Servilius Geminus was racing to reinforce his fellow consul. Servilius Geminus hoped to trap Hannibal between the two Roman armies. And since speed was of the essence, he sent the propraetor Gaius Centenius ahead with all his mounted forces. This body numbered 4,000 horsemen - 600 Romans, 1,800 Italians and 1,600 allied Cenomani Gauls. Hannibal's scouts spotted the approaching column, and he dispatched his marshal Maharbal with about 4,000 light infantry and 3,000 cavalry to intercept the Roman troopers. Somewhere in Umbria, Maharbal chose an advantageous site for an ambush and posted his light foot troops in concealed positions. Centenius approached with great haste and little caution. The Carthaginians lauched a missile barrage, and followed with a sudden cavalry charge. Half the Roman force was slain in the initial onslaught, and the remainder were driven back to a barren hill. Maharbal quickly surrounded the fugitives and forced their surrender. The Carthaginian victory was complete.</p><p>Without cavalry, Servilius Geminus' army was crippled, and Hannibal's Punic marauders were free to pillage Italy without interference. In Rome, the elder statesman Quintus Fabius Maximus was elected as Dictator, to begin his policy of delay and avoidance of battle - "Fabian Tactics."</p>

"Agathocles' Tower - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>When Scipio Africanus invaded Africa in 204 BC, Carthage was caught without a field army. Carthage entrusted its immediate defense to Hanno, son of Hamilcar. Hanno raised 4,000 cavalry - about 1,000 civic noble heavy cavalry, 1,000 Libyan cavalry and 2,000 Numidian mercenaries - and established a base at Salaeca. Scipio had 25,000 foot but brought only a little over 2,000 horsemen across the sea. Six hundred were Romans and the remainder allied Italian horsemen. While in Sicily, Scipio had summoned 300 noble cavalry from the Greek cities. Cleverly, he offered them the option of declining to join his army if they turned over their fine mounts, arms and armor and in this way Scipio re-equipped 300 of his elite Italian extraordinaire. The Numidian prince Masinissa joined Scipio, but with only 200 horsemen.</p><p>Even though Scipio was outnumbered, he decided to lure Hanno into an ambush. He posted his Roman and Italian horse behind a ridge overlooked by a watchtower built by the earlier Greek invader, Agathocles. Masinissa demonstrated in front of the Punic camp, and lured them out. Scipio and his deputy Laelius then charged over the ridge and surprised the Punic horsemen. Many were slain in the initial onslaught, though a few managed to turn and fight. When Hanno was taken prisoner, his command broke and fled. Scipio had won his first dramatic victory in Africa.</p>

"Cirta - Command and Colors" {

  <p>Following his victory at Agathocles' Tower, Scipio Africanus was penned in when Hasdrubal Gisgo and Syphax arrived with two large armies. Unable to face them in open battle, Scipio destroyed these armies with a treacherous night attack after feigning peace talks. A few months later, Scipio defeated these commanders once again at Great Plains. After the victory, Scipio dispatched his deputy Laelius, along with the Masinissa, to pursue Syphax.</p><p>Laelius was given most of the Roman cavalry and velites, along with a few cohorts of legionnaires, a total of 1,800 horse and 6,000 foot. Another 1,800 Numidians, mostly Massyles, had rallied to Masinissa. For fifteen days Laelius pushed across the desert in pursuit. Meanwhile, Syphax had fallen back to his capitol Cirta, to raise an army for a last stand. He managed to put 8,000 foot and nearly 5,000 horsemen in the field, but this army was raw and untrained. The infantry included some Roman-style cohorts, organized by the Roman centurion Statorious, who had joined Syphax in 213. When Laelius arrived outside Cirta, Masinissa charged impetuously. Syphax initially had the best of the fight, but as the Roman cavalry and infantry came up, the tide began to turn. Syphax rode to the forefront to rally his faltering troops, but his horse was killed and he was thrown and captured. Leaderless, the Numidian army broke. Masinissa brought Syphax in chains to Cirta, and the city surrendered.</p>

"Clusius - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>The Cisalpine Gauls (those living south of the Alps) had sacked Rome in 390 BC and fought intermittently with Rome for the next 150 years. After a series of defeates early in the 3rd century BC, the Gauls remained quiet for 50 years. But when the Romans began settling on captured Gallic lands in 232, this roused the barbarians to prepare another invasion. This time, the Cisalpine Gauls were joined by their kinsmen from across the Alps, the fierce Gaesatae under Kings Aneroestes and Concolitanus. in 225 BC, a force of 70,000 Gauls descended on Etruria and overran the country, looting and pillaging. When they reached Clusium, a city only three days' journey from Rome, a Roman army (led by a praetor whose name is lost to history) appeared on their heels, forcing them to turn back and confront it. The two armies camped for the night in close proximity. The Gauls kept their campfires burning but withdrew their infantry, leaving only their cavalry behind. The horsemen had orders to retire when the enemy approached, leading the Romans toward Faesulae, where their infantry would attack from ambush. At daybreak, the Romans, seeing the cavalry alone and thinking the Gauls had taken to flight, followed the cavalry with all speed. On their approach, the Gauls sprang from ambush and attacked them. A stubborn conflict took place, but finally the numbers and courage of the Gauls prevailed. The surviving Romans retreated to a hill, while the Gauls set up a loose blockade. These fugitives would all have been lost but the consul Aemilius Paullus arrived with a relief army that night. The Gallic kings chose to retreat with their booty rather than fight another battle. They broke camp before daybreak and retreated along the seacost through Etruria.</p>

"Raphia - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>The Wars of the Successors led to the establishment of three Hellenistic Kingdoms: the Antigonids (Macedon), the Prolemies (Egypt), and the Seleucids (from Asia Minor to India). The Seleucid Empire began to fragment, losing Judea and most of its eastern provinces and parts of Asia Minor. Antiochus III became ruler at the age of 18 in 223 BC, and immediately began restoring his empire. In 217 he retook Judea and marched on Egypt with 62,000 foot, 6,000 horse and 103 elephants. Ptolemy IV, with a much smaller army, enrolled native Egyptians into his Greek phalanx to bring his numbers up to 70,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry and 73 elephants. The two armies met at Raphia on the Egyptian frontier. Both armies deployed with their phalanx in the center and cavalry on the wings. Antiochus began the battle by charging forward with his right wing cavalry and breaking Ptolemy's left. The young Antiochus impetuously pursued the fleeing cavalry before him. Meanwhile, the Egyptian right swung forward into action and defeated its counterpart. With both wings wheeling in opposite directions, Ptolemy ordered his center to attack. Surprisingly, the Egyptian phalanx got the best of the veteran Seleucids and Antiochus' entire army broke and fled. Antiochus withdrew and Ptolemy recovered Judea. Despite this defeat, Antiochus went on to re-conquer his lost provinces and restore the great Seleucid Empire. Ptolemy, on the other hand, soon faced a major rebellion led by the Egyptian soldiers he had trained for the phalanx.</p>

"Cannae - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Finally aware of the true threat posed by Hannibal, the Romans assembled a truly large army, perhaps up to 80,000 strong, lead by two consuls and two pro-consuls. When both consuls were present, Roman tradition was for them to alternate overall command from one day to the next. Unfortunately, on the day of battle, the incompetent consul Varrus held command and determined to attack Hannibal, who had posted his army in a location that negated the Roman advantage in numbers - bluffs on one flank and the Aufidus river on the other. Undeterred, Varrus simply packed his legions one behind the other into the constricted area and launched the mass headlong at the Carthaginian center. They advanced into yet another trap.</p><p>Hannibal had deployed his excellent cavalry and heavy infantry on the wings, leaving his medium infantry and Celt levies in the center. The Roman advance did indeed push the Carthaginian center back and inflected losses, but in the meantime the Carthaginian cavalry had routed the Roman cavalry on both flanks and closed in on the rear of the Roman army while the heavy infantry advanced on both Roman flanks. Surrounded and unable to maneuver, the Roman soldiers were slaughtered by the thousands and the army was destroyed. Cannae was Rome's greatest military defeat and Hannibal's greatest victory.</p>

"Bagradas - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>The Romans are on the verge of defeating Carthage and ending the First Punic War. Regulus and a veteran Roman army landed in Africa, and, though woefully short of cavalry, defeated several Carthaginian forces. Desperate, the Carthaginians turned to an otherwise unemployed Greek general named Xanthippus, who knew how to train and command an army, as well as how to put the Carthaginian advantages in mounted troops into use. The Carthaginian army marched into Bagradas Valley and Regulus, confident of yet another victory, offered battle. It was to prove a costly mistake for him. The Carthaginian cavalry and elephants routed the Roman cavalry and then turned on the flanks and rear of the Roman army, now fully engaged with the Carthaginian infantry. The Roman army disintegrated. Those who survived told of the horror of being overrun by elephants and cavalry. This Carthaginian victory prolonged the war. It took several years before any Roman army would stand and fight against elephants. The larger lesson - proper employment of a combined arms army over a largely infantry army resulting in victory - was lost on the Romans. They had to re-learn it at the Trebbia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannae.</p>

"Beneventum - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>After the battle of Asculum, Pyrrhus left Italy for a three-year campaign in Sicily. Although he defeated the Carthaginians in every battle, he could not drive them off the island. Pyrrhus decided to return to Italy. Years of attrition and a naval defeat on his way back to Italy had greatly weakened his army. However, upon his return, his reputation brought thousands of new recruits out to join him. With 20,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and 20 elephants, Pyrrhus once again marched on Rome. Consul Manius Curius Dentatus gathered his army of about 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse and set up camp near Beneventum to await the Epirote army. Pyrrhus decided on a surprise night attack, but some of his detachments got lost. It was morning before he could organize his scattered forces near the Roman camp. Dentatus led his forces out and drove back Pyrrhus' vanguard. As the Roman attack continued it was in turn driven back by Pyrrhus' skillful use of his elephants. However, a second Roman assault stampeded the elephants into the Pyrrhus' phalanx. Dentatus struck while the phalanx was disordered and broke it, winning the battle. Pyrrhus withdrew from the field with what was left of his army and returned to Epirus, never to return to Italy. Beneventum was the final pivotal battle in the Roman Republic's bid for control of the entire Italian peninsula, and the first great victory of the legion over the phalanx.</p>

"Paraitacene - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>By 318 BC the Successors had formed two competing alliances: the "Royalists" who claimed to fight to maintain the empire for Alexander's infant sons, and a rival coalition that sought to claim their own independent kingdoms. The opposing Successor armies in Asia - one commanded by Antigonus, the other by Eumenes - met in battle at Paraitacene in 371 BC. Antigonus was by now the most powerful of the Diadochi, controlling most of Anatolia and the eastern satrapies. Eumenes had the backing of Alexander's heirs and a large war chest, though the fact that he was a Greek and not a Macedonian was a major handicap. Antigonus fielded 28,000 infantry and 11,000 horse. Eumenes' force of 35,000 foot and 6,000 horse included the veteran Silver Shields, who had fought with distinction in all of Alexander's campaigns. The battle opened with Antigonus' light horse attacking Eumenes' right. This attack was wrecked by Eumenes' heavy cavalry. Meanwhile in the center, the Silver Shields drove back Antigonus' phalanx. Antigonus' army was on the ropes when he pulled off a stroke that evened the score. He charged through a gap and was successful in routing Eumenes' left flank. Both sides at this point were exhausted and returned to their camps. Antigonus claimed victory, but realistically the battle was a draw and a final resolution would not be reached until the armies met at Gabiene, a year later.</p>

"Hydaspes - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Having gained control over all of the known civilized world, Alexander ventured into India in 326 BC. He met resistance from Porus at the River Hydaspes. Porus' large corps of 200 elephants thwarted all of Alexander's attempts to cross the river. Learning that a large force was moving to reinforce Porus, Alexander decisively divided his army and secretly crossed up-river with the majority of the Macedonian troops, leaving a large detachment in place to deceive the Indians. Upon receiving the startling news that Alexander had crossed the Hydaspes, Porus hurriedly turned his army to meet him in battle. Porus sent his chariots forward but these were quickly destroyed. Alexander then sent his cavalry to attack Porus' rigt wing and gained the flank of the Indian army, while his heavy infantry advanced to attack the elephants and bowmen. The elephants charged the phalanx and did great execution among the elite Macedonian infantry. Only the timely intervention of the light troops prevented a greater loss. Porus, wounded six times, was captured and the remainder of his army routed. Porus so impressed Alexander with his bravery that he was allowed to retain his kingdom as a Macedonian vassal. The power of the elephants was not lost upon the Macedonian generals who fought at Hydaspes. They would go to great pains to obtain elephants of their own during the Wars of the Successors.</p>

"Gaugamela - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Rather that pursue Darius after the victory at Issus (333), Alexander turned south to neutralize the Persian fleet. In a two-year campaign he captured Type and Gaza and conquered Egypt. In 331, Alexander marched into Mesopotamia, intent on attacking Babylon. Darius had raised another army, strong in cavalry but lacking in good infantry. The two armies met on the plain of Gaugamela. Darius posted cavalry on the right and the left and occupied the center with his Greek mercenaries, guard cavalry, elephants, and chariots. Alexander placed the Thessalian horse on the left, gave Craterus the phalanx in the center, and placed himself in person with the Companions on the right. The Persian line extended well beyond both flanks of the Macedonian formation. To counter, Alexander moved diagonally as he advanced, refusing his left. Darius ordered his mounted troops forward. The Macedonian right managed to hold their attackers just long enough for Alexander to charge with his Companions and heavy infantry straight for Darius. As he has at Issus, Darius turned and fled the field but the battle was not yet over. The Macedonian left was still hard pressed by the Persian cavalry. Alexander wheeled about and charged with the Companions into the Persian cavalry, forcing them back. Soon the entire Persian army was in retreat. Gaugamela is one of the truly decisive battles of history and marked the beginning of Alexander's great empire. This battle is also considered the classic example of penetration tactics.</p>

"Crimissos River - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>The Carthaginians learned from earlier defeats in Sicily that they had to field reliable, trained heavy infantry of their own. They formed the Sacred Band, a force of about 2500 excellently trained Carthaginians, as good or better than anything the Greeks of Syracusans could field. The Sacred Band formed part of a large army under Hasdrubal, advancing eastward to subjugate Sicily. Opposing him with a much smaller army was the able tactician Timoleon. Ever aggressive, Timoleon anxiously awaited an opportunity to strike the Carthaginians a hard blow on his terms. He got that chance when, on a foggy morning, Hasdrubal carelessly ordered his army to cross the Crimissos River without bothering to send out scouts (who would have reported that Timoleon's army was arrayed on the bluffs just beyond the river). Waiting until about half of the Carthaginian army had crossed, Timoleon unleashed his excellent heavy infantry phalanx against the surprised Carthaginians. Most who survived fled, but the Sacred Band stood their ground and were annihilated by superior numbers, (aided by a sudden rainstorm that slowed Carthaginian reinforcements crossing the river). Seeing the disaster unfolding across the river, the remainder of Hasdrubal's army broke and fled. The loss of so many citizen soldiers had a horrific effect on Carthage. The Sacred Band was reformed, but only once was it ever dispatched from Africa again, and then only for a very short campaign. Carthage would try to make do with mercenary troops as much as possible on Sicily, which had large repercussions at the end of the First Punic War.</p>

"Plataea - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>The Persian emperor Xerxes I led a massive invasion of Greece to avenge the defeat of his father's forces at Marathon. After annihilating the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, Xerxes burned Athens, then Macedon, Thessaly, and Boeotia submitted. However, following the loss of the Persian fleet at Salamis, Xerxes withdrew to Asia and left Mardonius with most of the Persian land forces to continue the subjugation of Greece. Amid much bickering, an allied Greek army was formed under the Spartan Pausanias, and moved to oppose the Persians. The Greeks were always careful to stay in terrain that negated the Persian cavalry, so the Persian cavalry turned to raiding... poisoning the Greek's water supply and destroying a large Greek baggage train. Short of water and food, Pausanias ordered a night withdrawal, but only the allies in the center did so. The Spartan right and Athenian left stood until first light. Seeing this confusion, Mardonius ordered a general advance, although Artabazus, in command of the reserve, suspected a trick and held back. Mardonis attacked the entire Greek line, with an onslaught that was particularly fierce on the Athenian wing. On the right, the Spartans held back until Pausanias obtained just the right "omens" from a sacrifice and then ordered them to charge. It was a desperate infantry battle but the better tactics and weapons of the Greeks finally turned the tide, killing Mardonius along the way. Artabazus managed an orderly retreat back to Asia Minor (he was rewarded with a hereditary satrapy), but the victory at Plataea meant the Persian threat to Greece was effectively ended.</p>

"Marathon - Command and Colors" {

  <p>King Darius I of Persia sent an expedition against Athens in reprisal for the burning of Sardes in 498 BC during the failed Ionian Revolt. The Persian fleet under the joint command of Datis and Artaphernes landed near Marathon bay, which offered a perfect battleground for their troops. The Athenians marched out to face the enemy in the field, with 1000 allied soldiers from Plataea supplementing the Athenian force of 9000. The Persians outnumbered the Greek, but to counter the disparity, Callimachus extended the Greek line to match the enemy, thinning the center while keeping both wings at full strength. The Persian army, with its best troops in the center, was taken by surprise when the Athenians attacked. Historians suggest that the some of the Persian cavalry was in the process of embarking back onto the ships when the attack started (it appears that the Greeks had waited for days before actually lining up for battle). In the battle the Persian center got the best of the weak Greek center and broke through, but this success was more than countered by the defeat of their two wings. The victorious Athenians then swung inwards and the Persian force was routed back to their ships. Concerned that the defeated Persians might still sail around to threaten Athens. Callimachus marched the Greek army back to Athens in "record time." (which is the true "Marathon race.") When the Persian ships reached Athens, they found an army waiting for them on Phaleron beach. Greece was safe, for now.</p>

  <p>Carthage is on the verge of defeat. Spain has been lost, Scipio has landed in Africa and beaten a large, but inexperienced, Carthaginian army at the Battle of the Great Plains. Masinissa has taken his vaunted Numidian light horse over to the Roman side. Hannibal is recalled from Italy, and hurriedly builds an army around the veterans he has brought with him. He creates a corps of war elephants and fields more infantry than does Scipio, but his arm of decision, his cavalry, is far weaker and less capable.</p><p>When the armies meet on the plains of Zama, Hannibal knows his cavalry on the flanks will be beaten, but stakes all on crushing the Roman center with his elephants and infantry before the victorious Roman and Numidian cavalry return from pursuing the Carthaginian horse. Scipio, knowing he is outnumbered, masses his legions in the center and fully intends for Masinissa and the cavalry to complete the encirclement and win the battle.</p><p>As the battle gets underway, both plans are working. The Carthaginian cavalry is driven quickly from the field while the Romans are pressed to keep their lines intact against the elephants and Carthaginian infantry. The flexible legions prove their worth as reserve lines move quickly to secure flanks or bolster the center. In te end Scipio's plan prevails. The Roman and Numidian cavalry return, the Carthaginian army is surrounded, and the valiant infantry is destroyed.</p><p>Scipio had perfected a better tactical system, and that system won at Zama over the legendary Hannibal. The rigid, but powerful phalanx, dominant for so long, had been beaten by the flexibility of Scipio's legions combined with cavalry. The baton of military supremacy had passed to Rome.</p>

  <p>Hasdrubal's departure to join Hannibal in Italy left only two Carthaginian armies in Spain under mediocre commanders (Hasdrubal - yes another one, and Mago). Scipio made steady progress against them, securing territory and prompting many Spanish tribes to come over to the Roman side. Forced to give battle or give up Spain, their most valuable province, the Carthaginian armies united and took up position on the plains outside of Ilipa.</p><p>For three days both armies deployed with their heavy infantry in the center and light troops on each wing. Scipio assumed that the Carthaginians would continue to deploy in this manner and he was correct. On the fourth day, Hasdrubal again deployed his army with the heavies in the center. Scipio this day sent light troops and cavalry to attack the Carthaginian camp and only after the Roman light screen retired did Hasdrubal see the Romans deployed with legionary infantry in both wings and Spanish troops plus lights in the center. The Roman cavalry and legions advanced and began to destroy both Carthaginian light wings. Hasdrubal was unable to send his heavies to support the wings for fear he would open a hole in the center that the Romans would pour through.</p><p>Both Carthaginian wings disintegrated and it looked grim for the heavies in the center until a providential thunderstorm allowed some of them to escape. The combined Carthaginian army was destroyed as a fighting force, and Spain now belonged to Rome. Scipio later crossed into Africa where his victories at The Great Plains and Zama would earn him the title "Africanus".</p>

"Arausio - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Following the Punic Wars, Rome set out to consolidate the territories it had captured beyond the Alps. At the same time, a major migration by the Cimbri, Teutons, and Ambrones, under the Kings Boiorix and Teutobod, was moving south, reportedly with over 200,00 men (more likely the fighters numbered about 50,000). Two Roman armies were sent to stop this migration with nearly 80,000 legionnaires. However, bitter differences between the Consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus and the Proconsul Quintus Servillius Caepio prevented the two Roman armies from cooperating, with devastating results. The Roman forces were camped by the Rhone River, near Arausio (modern Orange). However, the armies did not camp together. Caepio made his camp closer to the enemy (seeking to rob Maximus of the victory) and his dispositions are shown on the battlefield (Maximus and his army have made camp off map). The sight of two Roman armies made Boiorix cautios, and he entered into negotiations with Maximus. Caepio, motivated by hatred and envy of Maximus, foolishly launched a hasty attack on the barbarians. Caepio's army was annihilated in this piecemeal assault. With a boost in confidence from this easy victory, the barbarians proceeded to advance, pin Maximus' army against the river, and destroy it also. In terms of human lives lost, Arausio was among the most lethal battles in world history, and Rome's worst defeat since Cannae. The terrible defeat had one beneficial result for Rome. It gave Gaius Marius the opportunity to come to the fore and radically reform the organization and recruitment of Rome's legions.</p>

  <p>After Cannae, Rome struggled to rebuild its armies, but needed time. In Spain, Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal commanded an army large enough to possibly let Carthage win the war - if it united with Hannibal's victorious veterans. Standing in his way, however, were the legions of two capable (at last) consuls, the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Scipio. Both knew of the tactics used at Cannae, but felt the only way to counter encirclement was to quickly break the Carthaginian center. When the battle commenced, the Roman legions fiercely attacked the Carthaginian center, but, unlike Cannae, there was enough Roman cavalry to hold their flanks. Lacking cavalry superiority (and his brother's tactical genius), Hasdrubal was unable to surround the Romans before they broke through his center. His cavalry joined the retreat, leaving the splendid heavy infantry to its fate. Rome was granted the time it needed to live and fight another day. Eight years later, Hasdrubal finally was able to march to Italy, but lost both his army and his life at the Metaurus.</p>

  <p>Sparta and Argos were quarreling over Thyreatis, a territory which was occupied by Sparta, but belonged to Argos. The Argives marched out to recover their land, but instead of engaging in battle, the two armies agreed that rather than commit full armies, 300 of the best men from each side would fight it out to determine a victor. After a bloody contest, only three men remained, two Argives and one Spartan. The Argives claimed victory because of their numerical superiority and returned to their army. The Spartan also claimed victory, since their man was the last on the battlefield. The Argives sent their entire Hoplite army forward to settle the argument. An equally determined Spartan army met them. After heavy losses on both sides, the Spartans emerged victorious.</p>

  <p>Cleomenes I of Sparta, inspired by the words of the oracle at Delphi that he would take Argos, marched into Argive territory. It was here that the Argive army took up a defensive position. The Argive generals wanted to be forewarned of any Spartan attack, so they instructed their herald to listen to orders issued by the Spartan herald and then to repeat them to the Argive camp. Cleomenes realized what was happening and ordered his army to ignore the next meal call and charge the enemy instead. The Argives were taken by surprise and those who were not killed in the assault fled to the Sacred Grove. The Spartan army then marched to Argos. but a female poet named Fetesilla rallied the women and children to defend the city walls. After an initial attack the Spartans withdrew, as there was no honor in defeating women.</p>

  <p>King Xerxes desired to punish the Athenians for his father's defeat at Marathon and their support for Ionian revolts. He planned a second invasion of Greece in 480 BC and amassed a huge army to extend the Persian Empire into Europe. Several Greek city-states gathered around Athens and Sparta, and decided to slow the Persian advance at the narrow pass of Thermopylae. The Oracle at Delphi had announced that Sparta would either be destroyed or lose a King. Leonidas, one of the two Kings, chose the latter, leading 300 Spartansand other Greeks to one of History's most famous last stands. Xerxes waited four days for the small Greek force to leave. Then, for two and a half days he unleashed his army, wave after wave, against the Greek Hoplites who stood firm. The Persians did not prevail until Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing a goat path that led behind their lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, Leonidas fought to the death with his Spartans. Their epitaph reads: "Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient to their laws we lie". While a tactical victory, the heavy losses and the delay, inflicted by just a few hundred Greeks, was a significant blow to the Persian morale. In September, the Greeks defeated the Persians at the naval battle of Salamis and Xerxes, fearful of being trapped in Europe, returned to Asia with part of his army.</p>

"CnC-A 0616 - Plataea" {

  <p>The Persian emperor Xerxes I led a massive invasion of Greece to avenge the defeat of his father's forces at Marathon. After annihilating the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, Xerxes captured and burned Athens. Macedon, Thessaly and Boeotia submitted to Xerxes. However, following the loss of the Persian fleet at Salamis (480), Xerxes withdrew to Asia and left Mardonius with half of the Persian land forces to continue the subjugation of Greece. Amid much bickering, an allied Greek army was formed under the Spartan Pausanias, and moved to oppose the Persians. The Greeks were always careful to stay in terrain that negated the Persian cavalry. The Persian cavalry attacked anyway, but their commander Masistias was killed. Ceasing direct combat, the Persian cavalry began raiding effectively, poisoning the Greek's water supply and destroying a large Greek baggage train. Short of water and food, Pausanias ordered a night withdrawal, but only the allies in the center did so. The Spartan right and Athenian left were both still standing fast at first light. Mardonius ordered an advance to exploit his perceived advantage, and attacked the Athenian units on the Greek left wing. It was a fierce onslaught that prevented the Athenians from moving to assist the Spartans who were being pressed hard on the right. Holding back until the omens were right, the Spartans were finally ordered to charge, routing all before them and killing Mardonius. The sight of Persians retreating unnerved Artabazus'forces and they also fled the field. The victory at Plataea meant the Persian threat to Greece was effectively ended.</p>

"CnC-A 0617 - Mycale" {
  10630
  <p>In the spring of 479 BC, various Ionian cities began a revolt against their Persian rulers, and soon were forced to turn to the Greek mainland for help. A meeting was called in Athens, and a Greek fleet of 110 ships set sail from Delos under the command of the Spartan King Leotychides. The Persians, no longer confident after the crushing naval defeat at Salamis, dismissed their Phoenician naval contingent and moved the remainder of the fleet to Mycale, where they joined forces with the army that Xerxes had led back to Asia. The Greeks expected a naval battle, but when they approached the Persian camp, they found the ships beached and the Persian army in combat formation. The Athenians, under Xanthippus, landed on the beach and during their advance found a herald's scepter. Believing it was a divine sign that the Greeks had been victorious at Plataea, they charged forward without the Spartans. The Spartans had landed at another site and were still marching around the flank through the hills. The Persians repelled the Athenian assaults for a time, but eventually the Athenians manage to burst through to the Persian camp. The battle continued with no side certain of victory until the arrival of the Spartans, and the desertion of the Ionian Greeks, who joined in the attack on the Persians. The Persian army turned and fled to the mountains. Mycale ended the Persian Wars and the Greek cities in Asia were accepted into a league with Athens.</p>

  <p>The First Peleponnesian War (460-445 BC) broke out due to Megara's defection from the Spartan alliance, and Spartan envy and fear over the growth of the Athenian Empire. Nicomedes marched an army into Boeotia in 457 BC to intervene in a dispute between the Dorians and Phocians. He forced the Phocians to accept terms, but while he was in Doris an Athenian Fleet moved into position to block his return across the Corinthian Gulf. Athens, then sent out an army to meet the Spartans, and the two forces meet outside Tanagra. The Athenians brought a large contingent of Hoplites supplemented by a number of allies. The total number given by Thucydides is 14,000 plus a small contingent of Thessalian cavalry. The allied Spartan army consisted of 1,500 Spartans and 10,000 allied soldiers. According to Thucydides, the Thessalian cavalry joined the Spartan side during the battle, and the Spartans and their allies wore down and broke the Athenians. Both armies suffered heavy losses, but the Spartans won the battle and opened the way back home. This was the first major land battle of the war and began a pattern of Spartan dominance on land.</p>

"CnC-A 0619 - Olpae" {
  10630
  <p>During the Second, or Great, Peleponnesian War (431 - 404 BC) the Athenians recognized their inferiority to Sparta in land warfare, and chose to fight with proxy forces and at sea. Nevertheless, there were many small battles, and the clash at Olpae is representative. In 426, the Spartan general Eurylochus was operating in western Greece with a small force of Hoplites. He convinced the Ambraciots to invade Amphilokia, and their forces joined him at Olpae. in response, the Amphilokians called on their allies and the nearby Athenian fleet under Demosthenes. Demosthenes only had a small force, but was chosen to be the strategos, or commander, of the allied army. Eurylochus deployed with his Peleponnesians on the left and Ambraciots on the right. Demosthenes countered with his Messenians on the right, Arcanians in the center and Amphilokians on the left. Seeing that his army was badly outnumbered, Demosthenes extended his left wing with light troops and posted a picket force in hiding to ambush the Spartan right. When the lines clashed, Demosthenes sprung his ambush and routed the Peleponnesians, killing Eurylochus. Meanwhile, the Ambraciots also routed the Athenian left, but Demosthenes was able to keep his victorious wing in good order and attacked these troops, completing his victory. This victory recharged Demoshtenes' career, but gained little for Athens.</p>

  <p>After the Battle of Pylos, a force of Spartan soldiers was isolated on the island of Sphacteria. Demosthenes,commanding the force at Pylos, initially planned to starve the Spartans out, but it became clear over time that the Spartans would be able to hold out. He requested reinforcements from Athens. Cleon, with an Athenian expeditionary force, landed and moved inland, harassing the Spartans with missile fire whenever they attempted to advance to battle. The frustrated Spartans withdrew to the northern end of the island, where they waited behind their fortifications.A stalemate took place for some time, until an Athenian force burst into the Spartan rear using a route along the island's shore that had been left unguarded because of its roughness. The Spartans abandoned their defenses after Epitadas, their commander, was killed. Styphon, now in command, ordered his surrounded men to throw down their shields and surrender. The mystique of Spartan invincibility was shattered.</p>

  <p>In 424 BC, the Spartan general Brasidas led an army toward Thrace to threaten the only accessible part of the Athenian Empire. He reached Thrace and offered generous terms to the people of Amphipolis, who surrendered without a fight. In 423 BC, Athens and Sparta signed a truce, hoping to exchange Amphipolis for the Spartan hostages of Sphacteria, but Brasidas, against the wishes of the Spartan regime, continued to support the rebellion in the area. Athens ended the truce and sent Cleon with an army to recover Amphipolis. Brasidas would not emerge from the city for battle. Frustrated by the apparent Spartan timidity, Cleon began to move his troops back to Eion. Brasidas waited till the Athenian left wing marched past the South Gate, and with his best men charged out of the city, while Clearidas, his subordinate, emerged from the Thracian Gate with the rest of the Spartan army. The Athenians on the left wing fled to Eion, while those on the right fought bravely against Clearidas. Cleon was killed during the battle, and Brasidas mortally wounded. Athens agreed to stop the war and signed the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC. Sparta recovered their hostages and Athens the towns captured by Brasidas. Both sides would have time to prepare for the final phase of the war.</p>

  <p>Ironically, the greates Hoplite battle of the Peleponnesian War was fought during the Peace of Nicias (421 - 415). Athens was able to forge an anti-Spartan coalition. King Agis II of Sparta marched out to seek a decisive battle. The Spartan army numbered about 12,000 Hoplites, while the Argive coalition had 11,000. At first, the Argive army avoided combat, but when Agis emerged from a forest, he was surprised to find the Argive army drawn up close by for battle. Agis hastily deployed, placing about 1,000 Spartans on the right, in support of his 3,000 Tegeans. He commanded 5,000 Spartans in the center, surrounded by his personal bodyguard of 300 hippeis. On the left were the 600 skiritae (Spartan rangers) and 2,000 freed helots. The coalition countered with 3,500 Mantineans and allies on their right. In the center were the elite "Argive 1,000" and 5,000 regular Argives. Their left was held by Laches with Athenian cavalry and allies. As the battle began, Agis gave orders to fill the gap in his line, but there was no time and the Argive right wing quickly enveloped and routed the Spartan left. Meanwhile, Agis led a furious assault in the center shattering the Argive phalanx. The Athenian left collapsed. Agis kept his army under control, wheeled, and assaulted the Mantineans to complete his victory. The anti-Spartan alliance was crushed and Sparta would enter the final phase of the Peleponnesian War in a position of strength.</p>

  <p>In 415 BC Athens and Sparta were still under the Peace of Nicias, when the Sicilian city of Segesta requested help from Athens in their war against Selinus. Some Athenians saw this as an opportunity to take over all of Sicily,Syracuse, and even Carthage. Against his wishes, Nicias was elected general to lead the Sicilian Expedition. The Athenians used a double agent to trick the Syracusan army into marching to Catana, and when they took the bait, landed unopposed south of the Anapus River. There they took up a strong defensive position. When the Syracusans returned and found the Athenians waiting, they made camp for the night, intending to fight the next day. The Athenians, in a surprise move, attacked at dawn across the river. The unprepared Syracusan soldiers formed up as best they could in the short time before the Athenian force made contact. The Athenians used the river to guard their left as they advanced, and placed their light troops on the wings to fight off the Syracusan cavalry. Despite the greater depth of the Syracusan phalanx, the superior discipline and experience of the Athenians carried the day. However, they could not undertake an aggressive pursuit and score a decisive victory due to the lack of cavalry. It was a tactical victory without a strategic result. The Athenians sailed back to Catana for the winter, while the Syracusans prepared fot a siege and sent to Corinth and Sparta for help.</p>

Late in 404, Thrasybulus, leading a force of Athenian exiles, gathered at Phyle near Mount Parnes. The Thirty Tyrants, to keep watch on the exiles and prevent them from raiding the countryside, dispatched a Spartan force from Athens. The Spartan force was not expecting any trouble and set up camp. However, Thrasybulus, whose force of exiles had grown in numbers, attacked the Spartan camp. The attack caught the Spartan force in the midst of waking up and a total rout ensued.

The new government sent emissaries to Sparta, and Sparta sent Pausanias at the head of an army to resolve the situation. When Pausanias ordered the exiles to disperse, they refused. The following day, an Athenian exile force of light troops attacked the Spartans. Pausanias responded and ordered his cavalry and light troops forward with his Spartan Hoplites in support. The Athenian lights held for a time, giving Thrasybulus the opportunity to bring forward his Hoplites. The Spartan Hoplites engaged them and the exiles were defeated. After winning the battle, Pausanias suggested the government in Athens and the exiles talk. In time, the new government arranged a settlement between the oligarchs and the exiles that reunified Athens.</p>

Xenophon led an organized retreat through Carducia and Armenia toward the Black Sea, constantly harassed first by Persian armies and then by local tribes. Using part of his men, Xenophon created a small cavalry force and a body of archers to meed the tactics of the enemy. He reported the whole expedition in his Anabasis. Approaching the River Centrites, Xenophon found that the satrap of Armenia had occupied the far bank. The situation was desparate, but the next morning a better ford higher up the river was found, and to it the Spartans marched. The Carducians followed closely in pursuit. Cheirisophus began to cross, while Xenophon, made a feint to move back to the lower ford. The Armenians responded to the feint, which allowed Cheirisophus to gain a foothold on the other shore. Xenophon retraced his steps and made preparations to follow. The Carducians, saw their opportunity and began to attack the Greeks before they could cross. When most of the troops were over, Xenophon turned and charged the Carducians and they were dispersed. Then, before they could recover, he retired Trapezus, on the Black Sea. A few years later, Alexander would read the Anabasis and follow Xenophon's advice: Persia belongs to the man who has the courage to attack it...</p>

The Spartan army fielded about 18,000 Hoplites and lined up with the Spartans on the right and their Peleponnesian allies on the left. The coalition forces were made up of about the same number of Hoplites with the Athenians opposite the Spartans, while the Boeotians were on the right of the coalition line. As the lines advanced, both lines shifted to the right and when the two met each line extended past the opponents left flank, which meant that both right flanks overlapped the enemy line and were victorious. The Spartans, instead of pursuing the Athenians, quickly turned to the center and defeated the other coalition forces one by one.</p>

  10630
  <p>After the battle of Nemea, Agelilaus was moving south into Boeotia with an army of helots and veterans of the Ten Thousand, reinforced by some Spartan regiments and other allies. The coalition forces lined up to oppose him at Coronea. As at Nemea, both right wings were victorious, with the Thebans on the right breaking through, while the rest of the coalition forces fled to Mount Helicon. Agesilaus, assumed the battle was over when news came that the Thebans were at the baggage train, ransacking the loot taken from Asia. He immediately wheeled his Spartan forces around and headed for the Thebans. The Thebans, seeing that their allies had fled, formed up and attempted to break through the Spartans and join the rest of their army. What followed was one of the worst blood baths in the history of Hoplite battles. In the end, only a few Thebans made it to Mount Helicon.</p>

  <p>The Spartan commander at Lechaeum, honoring the tradition of the Amyclaeans in his army to return to their city of Amyclae to celebrate a religious festival, marched an escort force of Hoplites and cavalry past Corinth. After successfully leading his force well past the city of Corinth, the Spartan commander ordered his Hoplites to return to Lechaeum, while the cavalry continued on with the Amyclaeans. Iphicrates, who commanded the light troops in Corinth, seeing that the Spartan Hoplite force was unprotected by light infantry or cavalry, decided to attack the Spartans as they marched past the city. The Spartan commander ordered some of his men to charge the Athenians, but the slow heavily-armed Hoplites could not make contact. When the Spartans turned to return to their lines, the Athenian lights fell upon them again flinging spears, and inflicting casualties. This process was repeated several times, with similar results. Unable to drive off the Athenians, the Spartans were forced back to the hills which proved to be a bitter blow to Spartan pride.</p>

"CnC-A 0632 - Tegyra" {
  10630
  <p>In 379 BC, an insurrection ejected the Spartan garrison at Thebes, and the city set about reestablishing its control over the Boeotian League. After several years, the Thebans succeeded in driving Spartan garrisons out of every city in Boeotia, except Orchomenus. In 375 BC, Pelpidas set out with the Sacred Band and a small force of cavalry to seize Orchomenus. However, learning that a sizable force had been dispatched from Sparta to reinforce the garrison there, Pelopidas retreated. Before the Thebans could reach safety, they encountered the Spartan reinforcements. The Spartan fielded over 1,000 men; the Thebans, only 300. Plutarch reports that one Theban soldier, upon seeing the enemy force, said to Pelopidas "We are fallen into our enemies' hands", to which he replied "And why not they into ours?" Pelopidas then ordered the Theban cavalry to charge, while the infantry formed up into a dense formation. When the two forces came together, the compact Theban formation broke through the Spartan line and then turned to attack the Spartans to either side. The Spartan force broke and fled. The Theban victory had little immediate military significance. However, it marked the first occasion on which a Spartan formation had been defeated by a force of equal of lesser size in a set battle.</p>

"CnC-A 0633 - Leuctra" {
  10630
  <p>Sparta's victory over Athens in the Peleponnesian War (431 - 404) cemented the reputation of her hoplites as the premier infantry force in the world. However, Spartan arrogance following this victory led to the outbreak of hostilities with their former ally, Thebes. In 371 King Cleombrotos of Sparta marched against Thebes. When he reached Leuctra he found the Thegan army barred his way. The Spartans deployed in a long line with their allies on the left. Greek commanders traditionally placed their best troops on the right, and this wing usually led the attack. The brilliant Theban commander, Epaminondas, devised an innovative plan to mass his best men on the left in a 50-man deep phalanx. He intended to use this mass to break through the famed Spartan phalanx. Both sides sent their cavalry out and the Spartan horse were quickly defeated. Seeing his cavalry fail, Cleombrotos ordered his infantry to advance. Simultaneously, Epaminondas' massed left advanced against the Spartan right, while the rest of his army was ordered to hold back, in an oblique order. The Spartans were attempting to change formation to deal with the situation when the Sacred Band charged and hit them in mid-maneuver. Cleombrotos was killed and the massive weight of the Theban phalanx broke the Spartan line. Never before had Sparta experienced such a significant defeat, and Leuctra ended the era of Spartan military invincibility.</p>

"CnC-A 0634 - Mantinea" {
  10630
  <p>Thebes' shocking victory at Leuctra in 371 had ended the Spartan hegemony over Greece. Epimondas then organized the Arcadian League of cities in the Peleponnesus, in order to counter-balance Sparta and ensure Theban supremacy. A division in the Arcadian league led Mantinea to ally with Sparta. Sparta's hereditary enemy, Athens, even joined in the alliance against Thebes. Epaminondas invaded in 362 to reassert Theban dominance. In a plain near Mantinea he encountered the enemy force of 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse with the Mantineans on the right, Spartans in the center, and Athenians on the left. Epaminondas' force of 30,000 foot and 3,000 horse was deployed with massive depth on his left, the same tactic he had used successfully at Leuctra. The Thebans closed in on the Mantinean wing and then grounded arms as if not to battle this day. Once the Mantineans relaxed their guard, Epaminondas suddenly ordered the attack. The onslaught broke the Mantinean right flank, leading to the defeat of the entire Spartan army. Disastrously for Thebes, Epaminondas was killed in the closing moments of the battle. Sparta had been humbled again, but without her brilliant leader, Thebes was unable to maintain her hegemony over Greece. The ultimate result was a weakening of Greece that paved the way for the Macedonian conquest.</p>

"CnC-A 0635 - Chaeronea" {
  10630
  <p>Philip II gained the throne of Macedon in 359 BC and re-organized his army into a combined arms force. He then set on a long diplomatic and military campaign to dominate the Greek city-states. In 338, Athens and Thebes allied and took up a position at Chaeronea. Philip soon arrived to accept the challenge. Both armies numbered about 30,000 men. The Athenians were on the left under Chares, allies held the center, the Thebans stood on the right under Theagenes and the Sacred Band held the extreme right. Philip commanded the Macedonian right wing, placed his heavy phalanx in the center, and allies and mercenaries on the left with his son Alexander and the Companion Cavalry. Philip began the battle by withdrawing his right wing, provoking an advance by the Athenians. The Thebans advanced next and began to make headway, but Alexander led a furious cavalry charge and surrounded the Sacred Band. Meanwhile Philip ended his feigned retreat and assaulted the Athenians, who quickly broke. Once the Sacred Band had been eliminated, Alexander rolled up the Theban flank completing the Macedonian victory. Following this battle, nearly all the Greek cities (save Sparta) were forced to join the League of Corinth and accept Macedonian hegemony.</p>

"CnC-A 0636 - Megalopolis" {

  <p>Sparta had stood on the sidelines while Athens and Thebes battled Macedon at Chaeronea. As the Macedonian army plunged ever deeper into Asia, King Agis III sensed an opportunity to regain the hegemony of Greece for Sparta. Agis began secret negotiations with the Persians and obtained funding for a rebellion. in 331 the Macedonian army was stretched thin - Alexander was advancing into Mesopotamia, Antigonus was fighting an insurrection in Phrygia and Antipater, the strategos of Europe, was quelling a revolt in Thrace. Agis chose this opportune moment to attack Megalopolis, but Antipater quickly subdued the Thracians and headed south to face the upstart Spartans. Agis commanded 20,000 foot and 2,000 cavalry while Antipater had about 30,000 men. Agis's numerical inferiority convinced Agis to lift the siege and maneuver to a constricted battlefield. When the two armies clashed, Agis's Spartans broke through the Macedonian line at first, and his mercenaries drove back their opponents. Antipater brought up his reserves and stabilized his line. There was fierce fighting around the Spartan king and when Agis was slain, his army collapsed. The power of Sparta was broken for a century, and Alexander's home base was secure as he headed further east.</p>

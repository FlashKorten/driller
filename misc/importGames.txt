"The Drive on Metz - Patton in France" {
  33030
  <p>The Drive on Metz is a two-player game recreating General George S. Patton’s attempt to seize the key city of Metz and get across the Moselle River before the retreating Germans could form an effective defense. The American forces, comprised of three divisions of the 20th Corps, had just completed an epic pursuit across France after the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead. The exhausted Allied forces were at the end of their supply line and had barely enough resources left for one last push.</p><p>If they had been able to get across the Moselle River, they would have compromised the entire German Westwall defenses. This would have enabled Patton to make an attempt at crossing the Rhine before the end of 1944 and might have ended the war months earlier.</p><p>The defending German forces, four divisions of the 82nd Corps of the German 1st Army, were a combination of hastily collected and organized units, including fresh units from the German interior and remnants of units that Patton had been pursuing across France.</p><p>The battle, which began on 7 September 1944 and lasted for about a week, was a singular opportunity that could have gone either way. Historically, the Germans won, but just barely.</p>

"Battle for Moscow - Operation Typhoon" {
  49276
  <p>In September of 1941, the German High Command decided to launch a final, decisive offensive to crown their invasion of Russia, capture Moscow, and break the Red Army once and for all. Codenamed Operation Typhoon, German tanks and infantry pressed relentlessly forward until they could see the very spires of the Kremlin. As Russia’s communist government was burning secret papers and evacuating Lenin’s corpse eastward out of their ancient capital, Moscow was hanging in the balance. By 5 December, the Germans were halted along the entire front – exhausted and demoralized, having barely failed to capture their objective as the winter freeze grew ever colder.</p><p>Battle for Moscow is another in the popular series of classic introductory wargames from Victory Point Games offering new players something extra: a BattlessonTM. Relive this dramatic campaign on the Eastern Front of World War 2 while learning more about the fascinating hobby of wargaming, where you hold command as history holds its breath.</p>

"Assault on Sevastopol - Von Manstein in the Crimea" {
  34890
  <p>Assault on Sevastopol is a two-player game recreating Erich von Manstein’s attempt to clear the Crimean peninsula and seize the key port city of Sevastopol as a prelude to Germany’s 1942 summer offensive in Ukraine – the roads to which would lead to the fateful battle of Stalingrad. The Germans are attempting to clear this enemy bastion on the Black Sea and free up their forces for the great offensive to the north. The Russians are desperately trying to hold out as long as possible, falling back on great defensive terrain and strong fortified positions, hoping to delay the German invaders and extract as high a price as possible from them for the capture of Sevastopol.</p><p>But the Germans has prepared for this campaign. With complete air superiority, the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) relentlessly attacks from the skies, while special super-heavy siege artillery was slowly and carefully brought in and assembled expressly for this operation. It’s a hard-fought matter of time, distance, and attrition as you recreate the Assault on Sevastopol.</p>

Or will the German defenders of the 716th Division react in time, bringing up their anti-tank assets to stop the Canadians on the beaches as they did at Dieppe two years earlier? The German commander, Erwin Rommel, planned to stop the invasion on the beaches… and it nearly happened!</p>

It seemed that Murphy’s Law was in full effect: “Everything that can go wrong will go wrong – and at the worst possible moment.” Yet despite widely scattered air drops, confusion and stiff German resistance, an American victory was won and the beaches secured. However, the cost in lives of this close-fought campaign will see it always remembered as “Bloody Omaha.”</p>

"Danube 20 - The Battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram" {
  128252
  <p>When the capture of Vienna failed to bring the Austrians to the bargaining table, Napoleon sought more direct means of ending the War of the Fifth Coalition. His first attempt was a nearly impromptu effort to force a crossing of the Danube, then in full spring flood, with the handful of forces that were immediately available. Almost predictably, the resulting battle of Aspern-Essling resulted in a crushing French defeat. Stung by the setback, Napoleon then spent the next month and a half preparing for another assault at the same site, this time concentrating all available troops to ensure his success.</p><p>In the ensuing battle of Wagram, the second largest engagement of the Napoleonic era, Napoleon managed to defeat the Austrians but failed to achieve the decisive result he'd hoped for, forcing him to acknowledge that his foes were "no longer the enemy of old."</p>

"EuroFront" {
  22160
  <p>World War II was the defining event of the 20th century. When Adolf Hitler gained dictatorial power over Germany in 1933, his ambition went beyond the political control and economic exploitation of previous conquerors. He envisioned the extermination or enslavement of his victims, based on a ruthless ideology of racist totalitarianism.</p><p>Hitler concealed his true aims behind a cloak of conventional nationalism for as long as possible, gaining a series of bloodless conquests by threat and duplicity.</p><p>Finally Britain, his main geopolitical opponent, lost patience, took courage, and drew the line at Poland. A 6-year struggle for the survival of democracy, freedom and basic human decency ensued, costing 100 million lives. It was a close-run thing.</p><p>Untold thousands of acts of bravery, resolution and sacrifice had telling effects in battle. Others had none. Technical advances had a profound impact (we know now that code-breaking played a key role).</p><p>But in the end, it is very possible that the issue was decided by strategy.</p>

"Napoleon - The Waterloo Campaign, 1815" {
  1662
  <p>On June 18, 1815, one of the most decisive battles in military history was fought in Belgian fields twenty miles southeast of Brussels. Within a short 100 days, Napoléon, former emperor of France, had returned from exile on the island of Elba, again seized power, quickly assembled an army, and marched to defeat the dispersed British and Prussian armies now preparing to invade France.</p><p>Napoléon invaded Belgium on June15th, defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny on the 16th and after a day of pursuit, faced the British and Dutch army commanded by Wellington. Aided by superb defensive tactics and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, Wellington defeated the French in the great Battle of Waterloo, ending forever the military ambitions of the great Napoléon.</p>

"Successors" {
  26457
  <p>When Alexander the Great died in 323 BC, he left no clear heir to the immense empire he had conquered. It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander’s empire. By 305 BC they had given up on that endeavor and began to carve out their own kingdoms. SUCCESSORS is a four-player game based on those wars. Each player controls a faction of two or more generals and attempts to win the game through legitimacy or conquest.</p>

"Struggle of Empires" {
  9625
  <p>Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war players must form into two alliances.</p><p>Once allied with a player you cannot fight each other. This means you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he’s allied he’s with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn’t really want to fight him.</p><p>On top of this you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution. Even though it is a big empire building game it will scale from 2 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules.</p>

"1805, Sea of Glory" {
  23685
  <p>Spring, 1805 - Napoleon’s Grande Armée is encamped along the shores of the English Channel. Following the teachings of Alexander the Great, the French Emperor seeks to defeat a naval power from the land. He has but to place 100,000 troops on British soil and France’s hereditary enemy will finally fall. To do this, his combined fleet must control the Channel long enough for hundreds of shallow draft boats to ferry his troops to England. Standing in the Emperor’s way is the Royal Navy.</p><p>The year 1805, which is punctuated by the British naval victory at Trafalgar, represents England’s darkest time during the Napoleonic Wars. The threat of invasion looms large. Her great Wooden Walls offer the island nation its only defense against a far superior foe.</p><p>1805: Sea of Glory examines the naval war on an operational level during that pivotal year. Although Trafalgar shines through history as the beacon of victory, it is the successful blockade of enemy ports that kept French boots from stepping onto British soil. But 1805: Sea of Glory is more than a game about blockade duty. It is a game of breakout and pursuit, deception and false leads, husbanding meager resources, striking a blow where your enemy least suspects, and bringing about the decisive naval battle that defines victory or defeat.</p>

"Thirty Years War - Europe in Agony" {
  2748
  <p></p> direct descendant of Paths of Glory, 30 Years War covers the confusing post-Reformation conflict in central Europe, as the Holy Roman Empire attempts to reassert domination over the protestant states. On the side of Catholicism we have the Holy Roman Empire (Austria and some of Northern Italy at this point) and Spain, opposed by a cast of thousands: the German Protestants, Sweden at the height of her power, France, England, Denmark, and others.</p><p>While there are some new mechanics, virtually the entire game is borrowed from elsewhere: Leader activations and movement are as in Hannibal, combat is straight out of Paths of Glory (minus the flanking), and Siege resolves much Hannibal. Your armies have to be paid, with Aid Points that are received just like Paths of Glory's RPs. An interesting twist is that the movement and support of armies results in the landscape getting Pillaged, so as the game goes on the board becomes less and less capable of supporting military operations.</p>

  <p>In Bulge 20, the Allies don’t know which German strategic objective is being pursued. Allied intelligence work is required to ascertain the real German intentions so as not to overreact to the threat, because this time, the Germans can win if their staff can outthink and outmaneuver the Allies’ staff!</p>

"Borodino 20 - Napoleon in Russia 1812" {
  38361
  <p>Designer Lance McMillan marches the Napoleonic 20 game system to the very outskirts of Moscow where a brutal campaign culminates in a titanic battle between the exhausted French Grande Armée and the entrenched Russian Army whose divided and bickering leadership has led them to this fateful moment. In Borodino 20, players can recreate the historical battle and the human foibles of the commanders fighting it. In addition, they can experiment with scenarios presuming a faster Russian response to the French threat, or Napoleon heeding the advice of his “Iron Marshal,” Davout, to try a daring flanking maneuver. Featuring only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and “friction of war” which gives players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!</p>

  <p>The Napoleonic 20 game system expands with France’s long-planned invasion of England finally launched! With only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns providing the operational pauses and “friction of war” that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic campaign as the armies close for battle. With his newly trained and organized Grande Armée, Napoleon masses his forces in Boulogne for the great invasion. The Franco-Spanish fleet arrives on time to seize control of the English Channel, and a hell-for-leather landing is made aimed straight at London – the Kent Campaign ensues! With special post-landing maneuvering and naval conflict abstractions, Albion 20 adds many fascinating new features to simulate this campaign. Will the Emperor finally triumph over his archrival, “Perfidious Albion?” Or will there always be an England?</p>

  <p>Jena 20 is the second title featuring Joseph Miranda’s innovative Napoleonic 20 game system. With only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns, it is the addition of ‘story-driven’ random event cards and night game turns providing the operational pauses and “friction of war” that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic campaign as the armies close for battle. Following France’s glorious victory against the combined Austro-Russian armies at Austerlitz the previous December, the Prussians have finally come off the fence and declared war against Napoleon. As both sides maneuver, uncertain of the location or center of gravity of the opposing army, they meet in a dramatic double battle on the fields of both Jena and Auerstadt. Can the heirs of Frederick the Great maintain their composure and cohesion long enough to teach the haughty French a lesson, or will Napoleon and his Marshals ride on to ever greater glory?</p>

  <p>By November, Operation Typhoon is in full swing. The Wehrmacht is at the gates of Moscow. Up North, Klin has fallen and the XXXXth Panzer Korps is rumbling towards the Soviet capital. But the Russians are hanging on somehow, with "General Winter" on their side. On the 27th, the thermometer fell to -40 degrees celsius. For the Germans who thought they'd be in Moscow long before now, Hell has frozen over! Tank tracks are soldered into the frozen mud, weapons are too cold to hold with bare hands, and men are dying in place. The 2nd Panzerdivision manages to reach Lobnia and Kimki, 10 miles from the Kremlin, but can't go any further. The Russians have thrown all they have, including factory workers, to protect Mother Russia. The Germans stop and go on the defensive. Initiative has changed hands...</p>

  <p>By October 1942, Stalingrad had become a matter of personal prestige for both Stalin and Hitler, and the sole focal point of the Campaign in the East, above and beyond any strategic military consideration. In mid-October, the Luftwaffe intensified its efforts agains the remaining Red Army positions holding the west bank. Luftflotte 4 flew 2,000 sorties on 14 October and 600 tons of bombs were dropped by German Stukas. The same day, three infantry divisions and two Panzer divisions, supported by battalions of combat engineers, surrounded the three northern factories. Their attack was directed against the center of the Soviet line. The 14th Panzer pushed forward and broke through. With the Tractor Factory nearly surrounded, the intensity of the attack effectively split the soviet 62nd Army in two. Knowing that the loss of the Tractor Factory would lead to the collapse of the Soviet's right flank, General von Paulus ordered fresh troops forward to dislodge the last Soviet troops entrenched there. At the same time, the German forces in the center began to turn south toward the Red Barricades...</p>

  <p>By the end of August 1942, Army Group South (B) reached the Volga, north of Stalingrad. In a matter of days, 4th Panzer Army, with the 29th Motorized Division in the lead, headed for the river south of the city, effectively trapping Lieutenant General Chuikov and the men and women of the 62nd Army. Stalin's order of July 27 - "Not a step back!" - was no longer just an obligation but a necessity, and its slogan "There is no land behind the Volga!" the harsh reality that now faced all of the city's inhabitants.</p><p>Having witnessed firsthand on the Russian steppe the devastating effectiveness of German Blitzkrieg tactics, Chuikov turned the carpet-bombing of the city to his advantage. Anchoring his defense lines in bombed-out buildings that overlooked strategically important streets and squares, he ordered Soviet troops to "hug the enemy". Always keeping the front lines as close to the Germans as physically possible, often a mere floor or door frame away, he successfully negated much of the Germans' firepower and combined arms superiority. At such a close range, German infantry soon found themselves forced to fight on their own; or risk taking casualties from their own close air and artillery support! Key landmarks, such as the South Railway Station - which changed hands 14 times in 6 hours; and the Grain Elevator - where combat raged for weeks, became part of history. A year later, the city's defenders were collectively recognized for their courage with the gift of a ceremonial broadsword whose etching reads: "To the steel-hearted citizens of Stalingrad - the gift of King George VI - in token of the homage of the British people."</p>

  <p>After a month of heavy fighting, the Germans finally lost Hill 192 the previous night (See "Attack on Hill 192"). For the first time since June they no longer dominate the road to Saint-Lo. Should US High Command be able to deploy the 5th Corps into a large-scale armored offensive, the city will finally be within reach. But the German elite Parachute units have taken advantage of darkness to pull back onto Hill 101 in the vicinity of the Bayeux Highway near la Boulaye, as well as onto Hill 147 on Martinville's Ridge northeast of Saint-Lo. Reinforced by elements of the Panzer Lehr, they have set up a line of defense in te endless cover of fields, woods and streams. Their airpower grounded by poor weather and their tanks mired in unforgiving "bocage" country, the Allies must place the burden of the attack on the shoulders of their infantry yet again. What awaits the weary US troops will forever be known as "Hedgerow Hell"...</p>

"Agrigentum - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  The First Punic War began when Rome decided to invade Sicily in 264. Carthage, unprepared, scrambled to raise an army under Hannibal Gisgo. By 262 Hannibal arrived with an advance force at Agrigentum, but the Roman consuls Lucius Postumius Megellus and Quintus Mamilius Vitulus made a preemptive strike and placed him under siege. Months later, Carthage dispatched a relief army of 30,000 foot, 4,500 horse and 60 elephants under Hanno the Elder. Megellus and Vitulus detached about a quarter of their army to guard Hannibal, and brought the remaining 35,000 foot and 3,000 horse onto the field. Hanno organized his army with the mercenaries in the van, his elephants in a second line and his African levies in a third. As the armies clashed the mercenaries fought fiercely at first, but eventually buckled. As they routed into the line of elephants, all hell broke loose. The elephants were caught up in the pandemonium,and began to rampage in all directions. The third Carthaginian line was thrown into confusion, but rallied to resist the advancing legions. After more hard fighting, the Punic army broke. The largest battle of the First Punic War had ended in a decisive Roman victory, but ironically Hannibal's army was able to escape. Toman losses in the battle and the siege were so heavy that Megellus and Vitulus were denied a triumph, despite their victory.

  Following the defeat at Iliturgi, the Carthaginians made an unsuccessful attempt against Intibili, and then withdrew to the south. Early in the spring (214) they dealt with a major Iberian uprising, crushing the rebel army and re-imposing Punic authority. Many more Roman allies would have defected if Publius Scipio had not hurried south with one legion, about 10,000 men. Scipio camped near Castrum Album, famous as the site of Hamilcar Barca's death fourteen years earlier. Hasdrubal, Mago and Hannibal infiltrated the surrounding area undetected. They brought only fast-moving light infantry and mounted troops. When Publius Scipio advanced from Castrum Album towards his brother Gnaeus' camp, he was beset by Punic skirmishers and Numidian horsemen. The light Carthaginian forces showered the slow moving Roman column with javelins, sling-stones and arrows. Whenever the Romans charged, their opponents melted away. Publius' command was in danger of annihilation, and he just barely cut his way through to the safety of his brother's camp. Over 2,000 Romans were left dead along the route of his march, and many of the survivors were wounded. It was a clear Carthaginian victory. Hasdrubal, however, was unable to exploit the superiority of his Numidians for long, as a major revolt broke out in Africa and many of his elite cavalry deserted. The campaigns of the five armies would continue until both Roman armies were destroyed and both Scipio brothers killed at the battles of Castulo and Ilorca (211).

  <p>Saumur - June 19, 1949. The Battle of France is lost; the Germans are now ready to cross the River Loire. The meager French troops standing ready and lined up to defend it are the Officer Cadets from the Cavalry School at Saumur, reinforced with a Battalion of the Infantry School at St-Maixent and hodgepodge remnants of the French army. At the first sight of the enemy, they blow the bridges. Embarking on rafts, the Germans soon attempt to cross the river on the islands at Gennes and East of Saumur. The cadets, dug-in and with no real option for retreat, resist heroically, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Their valiant efforts are not enough however, and by June 21, the Germans are already breaking through to the South-West. The following day, June 22, 1940, the French army capitulates: The armistice is signed at Rethondes, and takes effect on June 25.</p>

  <p>Adopting the Dyle Plan, the cavalry corps of Gen. Prioux moves into Belgium, ahead of Gen. Blanchard's 1st Army to confront the German invaders. Near Hannut, French scout units find themselves facing incoming fire from frontline German units. From there on, their mission is to hold back or at least delay the Germans - hoping to gain time for the slower Allied corps elements deploying along the Dyle. The two light motorized divisions (DLM) of Gen. Prioux bear the brunt of the assault, facing two formidable Panzer divisions and five supporting infantry divisions. Despite this unequal match of forces, the 2nd and 3rd DLM manage to hold the Germans back for two days, saving the Dyle Plan. On May 14, decimated but their mission accomplished, the DLMs withdraw to the rear.</p>

  <p>The largest airborne operation of all time, Operation Market Garden was a bold attempt by Field Marshal Montgomery to drop three entire Airborne Divisions behind the enemy lines, in German-occupied Netherlands. Their tactical objective: To capture and hold all the major water crossings along a narrow 60-mile stretch of highway and into northern Germany. British XXX Corps would then rush onwards from the Dutch-Belgian border and across the Maas and Lower Rhine to outflank the Siegfried Line and choke off the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland.</p><p>The daylight drops were initially successful, with the capture of the Waal bridge at Nijmegen, but German resistance was stronger than expected; the British 1st Airborne Division failed to secure the bridge at Arnhem. British ground advance was hampered by marshy ground. Eindhoven was eventually captured by a joint Airborne and Armor assault, but British XXX Corps failed to relieve the 1st Airborne Division. Despite the latter's valiant hold out at Arnhem bridge, the planned advance had to be abandoned and Monty wouldn't cross the Rhine until the spring of 1945.</p>

  <p>Hot on the heels of their success in Operatsiya Bagration, Soviet forces struck deep towards the Baltic coast, rapidly severing communications between German Army Group North and what little was left of Army Group Center. By early October 1944, the Soviets were in view of the Baltic Sea, near the port of Memel, definitively cutting off Army Group North from any retreat route through East Prussia.</p><p>Despite Guderian's plea for an evacuation by sea and subsequent redeployment in Central Europe where forces were desperately needed to help stabilize an increasingly dicey situation, Hitler stubbornly refused. Instead, he ordered the 200,000+ German troops to entrench themselves, in the hope of using the Courland Pocket as a springboard for a future offensive.</p><p>Little did the F&uuml;hrer realize that what he insisted on calling a bridgehead (the Kurland-Br&uuml;ckenkopf) would only become a bridge to oblivion for his haplessly trapped German divisions; They would go on to resist six major battles before finally surrendering to Marshal Govorov on May 8, 1945. The majority of the 200,000+ men of Army Group North would be marched into Soviet prison camps to the East, most of them never to return.</p>

  <p>A raid on the German-occupied coastal town of Dieppe, Operation Jubilee was intended to demonstrate the Allies capacity to seize and hold a major port for a short while. The Canadians sent in just couldn't imagine how short their stay would be...</p><p>The landing beach was a mile long, with headlands at both ends and barbed wire across its entire length. At first, enemy fire was light, letting the landing troops - Essex Scottish Regiment on Red Beach and the Hamilton Light Infantry on White Beach - make it through a first row of wire and toward the sea wall with only minor losses. But tanks from the 14th Canadian Tank Batallion had not arrived ahead of the infantry landings as planned; and once landed, they could not get any traction on the loose beach pebbles. To make things worse, the men of the Royal Regiment landing on Blue Beach near Puys arrived late. They were pinned on the beach, unable to move west and take the eastern headlands before the main assault. The Germans, now on full alert, swept the exposed Canadian forces. Control of the Casino and surrounding pillboxes sea-sawed back and forth but to no avail. Four hours after landing, the Allied commanders were forced to call a retreat, leaving almost 60% of the men who'd landed killed, wounded or captured! The lessons learned from this debacle were painful, but were of considerable help in preparations for the landings in Normandy, two years later.</p>

Having successfully withstood a 9-months siege the previous year, the city was left to the protection of the 2nd South African Division's General Klopper. The city's defense perimeter consisted of 30 miles of wire entanglements, minefields and prepared infantry positions. In support were a limited number of tanks and artillery.</p><p>Rommel's attack from the South East came on the 20th. Under cover of a morning mist, German engineer units crept forward, clearing mines and wires. Once the mist cleared, the British saw a mass of troops and vehicles approaching. A horrific artillery bombardment followed by a wave of bombers left no doubt the battle had begun. The German Panzers and infantry rolled forward through the wire and minefields. A valiant British armor counter-attack with artillery support briefly halted the advance but by noon the Germans had reorganized and resumed their advance. Once the line at Kings Cross fell, the way to Tobruk lay open and the British command structure disintegrated. Klopper ordered the white flag to be raised...</p>

"Memoir '44 1/5142 - Counter-Attack of the BEF" {
  10630
  <p>France, May 1940 - With the first of Guderian's Panzers reaching the English Channel near Noyelles-sur-Mer, the Allied forces find themselves cut in two. The situation soon becomes untenable. Thankfully, Lord Gort's British Expeditionary Force (BEF) has withdrawn from Belgium and is now in the vicinity of Lille. He orders General Francklin, commander og the 50th Infantry Division,j to lead a counter-attack. He splits his forces in two: on the left, the 4th Royal Tank Regiment and the 6th Durham Light Infantry; on the right, the 7th RTR and the 8th DLI, now providing the "Franckforce" its backbone. The French of the 3rd DLM (3rd Mechanized Light Division) provide cover on its right flank.</p><p>The British armored columns circumvent Arras by the South, taking Rommel's 7th Panzer "Phantom" Division by surprise. Panicked, the motorcycles of 7th Kradsch&uuml;tzen Rgt make a hasty retreat; the German anti-tank guns find themselves powerless against the heavily armored Matildas, and are soon crushed. But Rommel's personality saves the day: he orders his campaign artillery and flak to score direct hits on the British tanks. Then, with evening fast approaching, the Luftwaffe puts a decisive end to the Allied counter-attack. During the night of May 21-22, the BEF falls back on its initial position. Lord Gort is now left with a single option - ordering evacuation of the BEF by sea, at Dunkirk.</p>

"Memoir '44 2/4643 - Battle of Abbeville" {
  10630
<p>France, May 1940 - The Allied High Command has already ordered several counter-attacks against the German bridgehead on the Somme river to the south of Abbeville; alas they have all failed. After the defeat of the British 1st Armoured Division, it is the 4th French Armored Division (4th DCR) of De Gaulle, recently promoted to temporary General, that is called to action. With all the might of its 150 armored vehicles, including 30 B1-bis heavy tanks and 3 infantry battalions supplemented by the 22nd RIC on load from a neighboring division, the 4th DCR hammers the positions of the 57th Infantry Division on the bridgehead.</p><p>On May 28, the French seize Huppy and progress toward the Somme, crushing the German anti-tank guns which are ill-equipped to pierce the heavy armor of the B1-bis. On the German side, chaos ensues and troops start withdrawing toward Abbeville. Evening falls and the French, not realizing the scope of their success, fail to press their advantage further. On the 29th, the French renew their push, primarily toward Mont de Caubert. But the German troops dug-in on these heights use their Flak 88 guns to repel any advance, destroying several heavy tanks, and managing to hold the line. By the end of the day, the opportunity to push the Germans back behind the Somme has vanished. On the 30th, the French launch one final attack against Mont de Caubert, where they face a reinvigorated opponent. By the 31st, they are spent and replaced by the 51st "Highland Division". Abbeville is still in German hands.</p>

  <p>The early hours, morning of June 6, 1944 - Men of the British 6th Airborne Division airdrop inland to capture the bridges over the Orne River and canal to prevent the German armored formations in the area between Normandy and Paris from moving west to attack the left flank of the upcoming Allied beachhead. Shortly thereafter, the 8th Brigade Group of the 3rd British Division, supported by Commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade and the amphibious Sherman tanks of the 13th and 18th Hussars, land on Sword beach. The Germans are about to find out how illusory the protection of ill-named strong-points Cod and Trout really are, in the face of a determined armada...</p>

In the space of a few minutes, 200 men fall in front of withering fire from strong-point Cod. But others keep moving, followed by Special Forces, and by noon they've seized all their objectives. The road to Caen is now open...</p><p>That same day, on the outskirts of Caen. The Germans muster the only sizeable unit within reach, the 21st Panzerdivision. Around 16:00 the Division's Kampfgruppen lead the charge. KG Rauch reaches the coast between Luc-sur-Mer and Lion-sur-Mer and cordones off the Brits on Sword Beach from their Canadian brethren on Juno. But the spectacular arrival of hundreds of British gliders over St Aubin d'Arquenay puts a stop to the Germans, who are soon forced to retreat back to Caen.</p>

  10630
  <p>Taking advantage of the departure of two armored divisions hastily sent west to counter the 1st US Army's Operation Cobra, Montgomery sends the 2nd British Army to the assault of the Virois bocage in Operation Bluecoat. Their first objectives are two heights to the east of Saint-Martin-des-Besaces: Hill 226 and Hill 309. On July 30, the German front lines, held by the 276 and 326 Infantry Divisions who were entrenched behind minefields, are bombarded and then eviscerated by the assault of the 15th "Scottish Division" and 43rd "Wessex Division" along with support from the "Crocodile" flame thrower tanks of the 141st RAC.</p><p>Following the breach made by the British infantry, the tanks of the Guard Armoured Brigade rumble forward toward their objectives. But a surprise setback soon comes with the appearance on the battlefield of the "Jagdpanthers" of the 654th sPzjg Abr, soon followed by the "Tiger II" tanks of the 503rd sPz Abt and a Kampfgruppe of the 21st Panzerdivision. During the day of July 31, the "Guards" lose many Churchill tanks from the repeated blows of the German heavy armor, but manage to hold their ground on the positions conquered earlier. Operation Bluecoat is now ready to move to its second phase - the capture of Mont-Pincon.</p>

  <p>While Patton's tanks roll through Brittnany, threatening France's center, Hitler orders Field Marshal Von Kluge to launch an armored counter-attack to cut the Avranches corridor. The Germans struggle to regroup 150 tanks from the remnants of four armored divisions before venturing into hedgerow country on the night of August 6-7. Initially they make good progress, except around Saint Barthelemy and Hill 317 near Mortain. But soon the fog lifts, unveiling a sky full of rocket-equipped Typhoons from the 2nd Tactical Air Force. The Panzer assault is stopped dead in its tracks. For the next 4 days, it's a duel to the last between the US Infantry and the German Panzers. Finally on August 12, Von Kluge is forced to call the retreat. The ultimate attempt to save Normandy has failed.</p>

  <p>With the landing of the Allied forces in Provence (Operation Dragoon), German occupation troops have been issued a general retreat order; As early as August 17, 1944, garrisons in the South-West of France evacuate en masse; their occupants, a long way from home, now begin their long haul back North. While motorized units are able to breakthrough and escape quickly, the same cannot be said for those on foot.</p><p>Marschgruppe S&uuml;d, under the command of General Elster, is the last one to depart; its soldiers find themselves constantly harassed by French Resistance fighters and the relentless strafing and bombardments of Allied warplanes that dominate the air. The Germans put up a good fight for survival but finally find themselves blocked against the Loire River, unable to cross the entrenched bridge in Resistance hands at Decize. Left with no attractive option, General Elster surrenders on September 16, at Beaugency, along with 20,000 of his men.</p>

  <p>Battle of the Bulge, morning of December 20, 1944 - Noville is already under attack, but the enemy seems to be grouping, rather than making a concentrated attack. Fog and snow have hampered the action and the beleaguered Americans can only tell what is happening from up real close. Allied Command has told them to withdraw to Foy, but with the fog, the sound of gunfire seems to swirl around them from every direction. Can the column make it to Foy, not to even mention Bastogne?</p>

  <p>April 1945 - The Third Reich is in its final throes. But Netherlands is still under the iron grip of the German forces, following the disaster of Operation Market-Garden. Heading North toward the heart of the Reich, the Canadian tanks and Polish artillery of 2nd Corps are making slow progress in the face of increasingly desperate German troops. Massive carpet-bombing could pave the way, but might break the dykes and flood the low-lying countryside. Queen Wilhelmina has successfully begged it off, in an effort to spare the civilian population.</p><p>So on the night of April 7, despite terrible weather, two sticks of French SAS - some 676 men from the 2nd and 3rd French Regiments de Chasseurs Parachutistes - jump behind the enemy lines, in the Drenthe province. Their objective: to capture bridges over the Canal, north of Groningen, and gain control of the airfield at Steenwijk, in a bid to trap the local SS troops. By April 9th lead elements of 2ns Corps' make contact with the French but it is only with the help and courage of the local population that total control is finally achieved two weeks later.</p>

The garrison in Tobruk even attempts a break out to connect with the Eight Army. After many engagements with various outcomes, Rommel is forced to order the remnants of Panzergruppe Afrika to retreat toward Gazala, beaten not by his opponent's strategy, but rather its overwhelming material superiority.

The German army took advantage of this by attacking the last standing French fortification: the Maginot line.

Supported by the divisional artillery and dive bombing from Stukas, and progressing under the cover of surrounding woods, the Germans captured the isolated bunkers one by one. Despite German success, the main fortresses remained unconquered under the armistice.</p>

"Iliturgi - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Following the decisive victory of the Scipio brothers at Dertosa (215), Carthage sent out 13,500 reinforcements for Hasdrubal Barca under his brother Mago. Hasdrubal reorganized his command of 18,000 men into three small armies, one under his command, one led by Mago and the third under Hannibal, son of Bomilcar. Once the Romans had retired north of the Ebro River for the winter, the Carthaginians struck back in late autumn (215) and besieged Iliturgi, a Roman garrisoned city. Each Punic commander set up a separate camp around the city. The citizens of Iliturgi and their Roman garrison soon suffered from hunger, as they had been caught unprepared. Gnaeus and Publius Scipio marched to the scene with two legions, about 18,000 troops, to lift the siege. Upon arriving, the Scipios decided to assault Hasdrubal's camp first, as it was the largest and the key to breaking the siege. As the assault on Hasdrubal's camp climaxed, the armies of Mago and Hamilcar arrived and the fighting spread out and intensified. Ultimately, the Romans emerged victorious, overrunning the camp and breaking the siege. However, the casualties were probably about equal on both sides. Since Rome was hard-pressed by Hannibal in Italy, the Carthaginians could more easily replace their losses, and benefited from such battles of attrition. On the other hand, Carthage needed a decisive victory before reinforcements could be sent to Hannibal in Italy. The campaigns of these five armies continued for another four years.</p>

"Cissa - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>As the Second Punic War began (218 BC), Hannibal first conquered northern Spain. Before heading to Italy, he left his brother Hasdrubal with about 15,000 men in southern Spain and Hanno with 11,000 men in the north. The consul Publius Scipio had been assigned an army of 24,000 with which to invade Spain and defeat Hannibal. However, when Scipio arrived in Massilia, he was shocked to discover Hannibal's army was headed to the Alps. Publius returned to defend Italy, but he sent his army on to Spain under his elder brother Gnaeus. The Romans were not expected so late in the year, and quickly overran northern Spain and then advanced on Hanno's camp at Cissa. Hanno had been reinforced with a few thousand Illergete warriors under Indibilis. Although still heavily outnumbered, Hanno decided to occupy a strong position on high ground rather than retreat to join Hasdrubal. Gnaeus Scipio did not hesitate and charged his army up the heights in a frontal assault. The fighting was brutal, but the outnumbered Carthaginians were eventually driven off the heights in flight. Reportedly, Carthage lost 6,000 killed and 2,000 captured, including both Hanno and Indibilis. Despite suffering heavy losses, the Romans had the victory. The Romans had established a foothold in Spain. Indibilis was later released, an act of clemency Gnaeus Scipio soon came to regret. Publius finally arrived a year later, bringing a third legion of 8,000 reinforcements. Each of the Scipio brothers could now command his own army in Spain.</p>

"Caralis - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Sardinia had been a Carthaginian province for centuries until the turmoil of the Truceless War (241-238) allowed Rome to opportunistically seize the island. This incident fed the hatred of Hamilcar Barca and his sons for Rome. While Hannibal was crossing the Alps to invade Italy, the agent Hanno slipped onto the island to foment a tribal rebellion. After Hannibal's great victory at Cannae, Hanno instigated an island-wide uprising under King Hampsicora and sent messengers to Carthage for support to capture the weakly garrisoned island. An expedition under Hasdrubal the Bald was delayed by a storm. While Hasdrubal was re-fitting his fleet, the Romans scraped up a reinforcing legion under the septuagenarian noble Titus Manlius Torquatus, who was already on the island when Hasdrubal finally arrived. The two armies met near Caralis. Hasdrubal, with about 20,000 men and 20 elephants, posted his Sards on one wing and his African and Balearic expeditionary forces on the other. Torquatus grounded his fleet and pressed his sailors into service to swell his ranks to 22,000 foot and 1200 horse. The fighting was fierce and prolonged. Eventually, the Sard wing collapsed and Hanno's African wing, which had been fighting well, was taken in the flank and also routed. Reports said 12,000 Sardinians and Carthaginians were slain and about 3700 men, including Hasdrubal and Hanno, were taken captive. Hampsicora commited suicide when he learned that his son Hostus had been killed in the fighting. Sardinia would remain in Roman hands.</p>

"Himeras River - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Western Sicily had been a Carthaginian province for centuries, until Rome captured it in the First Punic War. Hannibal sent an agent, Epicydes, to Syracuse to lead a rebellion agains Rome in 214. Rome responded by sending M. Claudius Marcellus against the city. Marcellus succeeded in taking Syracuse but the Sicilian campaign was not yet over. Epicydes rallied the remnants of the Carthaginian and Greek armies at Agrigentum and Hanno arrived from Africa with a new army, including 3000 Numidian cavalry. Hannibal also sent one of his crack cavalry commanders, the Liby-Phoenician Muttines, who was soon dashing all over Sicily with the Numidians. The three Punic commanders built their army up to 20,000 foot and 3500 horse, but Hanno, jealous of Muttines' success, ordered him to not march with the army. Marcellus marched against them with about 24,000 foot and 2000 horse. At this point, 10 Numidian deserters rode to the Roman camp and informed Marcellus that their countrymen were furious at the insult to Muttines and intended to take no part in the battle. Hoping the news was true, but expecting a trap, Marcellus led his legions out to face the Punic army. As the Libyan and Greek infantry advanced into the fray, it became apparent that the Numidians were holding back. Marcellus ordered the Roman horse to turn the exposed Punic flank. When the Numidians did not respond, the Punic infantry became demoralized and broke. Marcellus had the victory.</p>

"Umbria - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Even as one Roman army under Flaminius was being butchered by Hannibal's troops at Lake Trasimenus in 217 BC, his colleague Gnaeus Servilius Geminus was racing to reinforce his fellow consul. Servilius Geminus hoped to trap Hannibal between the two Roman armies. And since speed was of the essence, he sent the propraetor Gaius Centenius ahead with all his mounted forces. This body numbered 4,000 horsemen - 600 Romans, 1,800 Italians and 1,600 allied Cenomani Gauls. Hannibal's scouts spotted the approaching column, and he dispatched his marshal Maharbal with about 4,000 light infantry and 3,000 cavalry to intercept the Roman troopers. Somewhere in Umbria, Maharbal chose an advantageous site for an ambush and posted his light foot troops in concealed positions. Centenius approached with great haste and little caution. The Carthaginians lauched a missile barrage, and followed with a sudden cavalry charge. Half the Roman force was slain in the initial onslaught, and the remainder were driven back to a barren hill. Maharbal quickly surrounded the fugitives and forced their surrender. The Carthaginian victory was complete.</p><p>Without cavalry, Servilius Geminus' army was crippled, and Hannibal's Punic marauders were free to pillage Italy without interference. In Rome, the elder statesman Quintus Fabius Maximus was elected as Dictator, to begin his policy of delay and avoidance of battle - "Fabian Tactics."</p>

"Agathocles' Tower - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>When Scipio Africanus invaded Africa in 204 BC, Carthage was caught without a field army. Carthage entrusted its immediate defense to Hanno, son of Hamilcar. Hanno raised 4,000 cavalry - about 1,000 civic noble heavy cavalry, 1,000 Libyan cavalry and 2,000 Numidian mercenaries - and established a base at Salaeca. Scipio had 25,000 foot but brought only a little over 2,000 horsemen across the sea. Six hundred were Romans and the remainder allied Italian horsemen. While in Sicily, Scipio had summoned 300 noble cavalry from the Greek cities. Cleverly, he offered them the option of declining to join his army if they turned over their fine mounts, arms and armor and in this way Scipio re-equipped 300 of his elite Italian extraordinaire. The Numidian prince Masinissa joined Scipio, but with only 200 horsemen.</p><p>Even though Scipio was outnumbered, he decided to lure Hanno into an ambush. He posted his Roman and Italian horse behind a ridge overlooked by a watchtower built by the earlier Greek invader, Agathocles. Masinissa demonstrated in front of the Punic camp, and lured them out. Scipio and his deputy Laelius then charged over the ridge and surprised the Punic horsemen. Many were slain in the initial onslaught, though a few managed to turn and fight. When Hanno was taken prisoner, his command broke and fled. Scipio had won his first dramatic victory in Africa.</p>

"Cirta - Command and Colors" {

  <p>Following his victory at Agathocles' Tower, Scipio Africanus was penned in when Hasdrubal Gisgo and Syphax arrived with two large armies. Unable to face them in open battle, Scipio destroyed these armies with a treacherous night attack after feigning peace talks. A few months later, Scipio defeated these commanders once again at Great Plains. After the victory, Scipio dispatched his deputy Laelius, along with the Masinissa, to pursue Syphax.</p><p>Laelius was given most of the Roman cavalry and velites, along with a few cohorts of legionnaires, a total of 1,800 horse and 6,000 foot. Another 1,800 Numidians, mostly Massyles, had rallied to Masinissa. For fifteen days Laelius pushed across the desert in pursuit. Meanwhile, Syphax had fallen back to his capitol Cirta, to raise an army for a last stand. He managed to put 8,000 foot and nearly 5,000 horsemen in the field, but this army was raw and untrained. The infantry included some Roman-style cohorts, organized by the Roman centurion Statorious, who had joined Syphax in 213. When Laelius arrived outside Cirta, Masinissa charged impetuously. Syphax initially had the best of the fight, but as the Roman cavalry and infantry came up, the tide began to turn. Syphax rode to the forefront to rally his faltering troops, but his horse was killed and he was thrown and captured. Leaderless, the Numidian army broke. Masinissa brought Syphax in chains to Cirta, and the city surrendered.</p>

"Clusius - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>The Cisalpine Gauls (those living south of the Alps) had sacked Rome in 390 BC and fought intermittently with Rome for the next 150 years. After a series of defeates early in the 3rd century BC, the Gauls remained quiet for 50 years. But when the Romans began settling on captured Gallic lands in 232, this roused the barbarians to prepare another invasion. This time, the Cisalpine Gauls were joined by their kinsmen from across the Alps, the fierce Gaesatae under Kings Aneroestes and Concolitanus. in 225 BC, a force of 70,000 Gauls descended on Etruria and overran the country, looting and pillaging. When they reached Clusium, a city only three days' journey from Rome, a Roman army (led by a praetor whose name is lost to history) appeared on their heels, forcing them to turn back and confront it. The two armies camped for the night in close proximity. The Gauls kept their campfires burning but withdrew their infantry, leaving only their cavalry behind. The horsemen had orders to retire when the enemy approached, leading the Romans toward Faesulae, where their infantry would attack from ambush. At daybreak, the Romans, seeing the cavalry alone and thinking the Gauls had taken to flight, followed the cavalry with all speed. On their approach, the Gauls sprang from ambush and attacked them. A stubborn conflict took place, but finally the numbers and courage of the Gauls prevailed. The surviving Romans retreated to a hill, while the Gauls set up a loose blockade. These fugitives would all have been lost but the consul Aemilius Paullus arrived with a relief army that night. The Gallic kings chose to retreat with their booty rather than fight another battle. They broke camp before daybreak and retreated along the seacost through Etruria.</p>

"Raphia - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>The Wars of the Successors led to the establishment of three Hellenistic Kingdoms: the Antigonids (Macedon), the Prolemies (Egypt), and the Seleucids (from Asia Minor to India). The Seleucid Empire began to fragment, losing Judea and most of its eastern provinces and parts of Asia Minor. Antiochus III became ruler at the age of 18 in 223 BC, and immediately began restoring his empire. In 217 he retook Judea and marched on Egypt with 62,000 foot, 6,000 horse and 103 elephants. Ptolemy IV, with a much smaller army, enrolled native Egyptians into his Greek phalanx to bring his numbers up to 70,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry and 73 elephants. The two armies met at Raphia on the Egyptian frontier. Both armies deployed with their phalanx in the center and cavalry on the wings. Antiochus began the battle by charging forward with his right wing cavalry and breaking Ptolemy's left. The young Antiochus impetuously pursued the fleeing cavalry before him. Meanwhile, the Egyptian right swung forward into action and defeated its counterpart. With both wings wheeling in opposite directions, Ptolemy ordered his center to attack. Surprisingly, the Egyptian phalanx got the best of the veteran Seleucids and Antiochus' entire army broke and fled. Antiochus withdrew and Ptolemy recovered Judea. Despite this defeat, Antiochus went on to re-conquer his lost provinces and restore the great Seleucid Empire. Ptolemy, on the other hand, soon faced a major rebellion led by the Egyptian soldiers he had trained for the phalanx.</p>

"Cannae - Command and Colors" {

  <p>Finally aware of the true threat posed by Hannibal, the Romans assembled a truly large army, perhaps up to 80,000 strong, lead by two consuls and two pro-consuls. When both consuls were present, Roman tradition was for them to alternate overall command from one day to the next. Unfortunately, on the day of battle, the incompetent consul Varrus held command and determined to attack Hannibal, who had posted his army in a location that negated the Roman advantage in numbers - bluffs on one flank and the Aufidus river on the other. Undeterred, Varrus simply packed his legions one behind the other into the constricted area and launched the mass headlong at the Carthaginian center. They advanced into yet another trap.</p><p>Hannibal had deployed his excellent cavalry and heavy infantry on the wings, leaving his medium infantry and Celt levies in the center. The Roman advance did indeed push the Carthaginian center back and inflected losses, but in the meantime the Carthaginian cavalry had routed the Roman cavalry on both flanks and closed in on the rear of the Roman army while the heavy infantry advanced on both Roman flanks. Surrounded and unable to maneuver, the Roman soldiers were slaughtered by the thousands and the army was destroyed. Cannae was Rome's greatest military defeat and Hannibal's greatest victory.</p>

"Bagradas - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>The Romans are on the verge of defeating Carthage and ending the First Punic War. Regulus and a veteran Roman army landed in Africa, and, though woefully short of cavalry, defeated several Carthaginian forces. Desperate, the Carthaginians turned to an otherwise unemployed Greek general named Xanthippus, who knew how to train and command an army, as well as how to put the Carthaginian advantages in mounted troops into use. The Carthaginian army marched into Bagradas Valley and Regulus, confident of yet another victory, offered battle. It was to prove a costly mistake for him. The Carthaginian cavalry and elephants routed the Roman cavalry and then turned on the flanks and rear of the Roman army, now fully engaged with the Carthaginian infantry. The Roman army disintegrated. Those who survived told of the horror of being overrun by elephants and cavalry. This Carthaginian victory prolonged the war. It took several years before any Roman army would stand and fight against elephants. The larger lesson - proper employment of a combined arms army over a largely infantry army resulting in victory - was lost on the Romans. They had to re-learn it at the Trebbia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannae.</p>

"Beneventum - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>After the battle of Asculum, Pyrrhus left Italy for a three-year campaign in Sicily. Although he defeated the Carthaginians in every battle, he could not drive them off the island. Pyrrhus decided to return to Italy. Years of attrition and a naval defeat on his way back to Italy had greatly weakened his army. However, upon his return, his reputation brought thousands of new recruits out to join him. With 20,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and 20 elephants, Pyrrhus once again marched on Rome. Consul Manius Curius Dentatus gathered his army of about 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse and set up camp near Beneventum to await the Epirote army. Pyrrhus decided on a surprise night attack, but some of his detachments got lost. It was morning before he could organize his scattered forces near the Roman camp. Dentatus led his forces out and drove back Pyrrhus' vanguard. As the Roman attack continued it was in turn driven back by Pyrrhus' skillful use of his elephants. However, a second Roman assault stampeded the elephants into the Pyrrhus' phalanx. Dentatus struck while the phalanx was disordered and broke it, winning the battle. Pyrrhus withdrew from the field with what was left of his army and returned to Epirus, never to return to Italy. Beneventum was the final pivotal battle in the Roman Republic's bid for control of the entire Italian peninsula, and the first great victory of the legion over the phalanx.</p>

"Paraitacene - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>By 318 BC the Successors had formed two competing alliances: the "Royalists" who claimed to fight to maintain the empire for Alexander's infant sons, and a rival coalition that sought to claim their own independent kingdoms. The opposing Successor armies in Asia - one commanded by Antigonus, the other by Eumenes - met in battle at Paraitacene in 371 BC. Antigonus was by now the most powerful of the Diadochi, controlling most of Anatolia and the eastern satrapies. Eumenes had the backing of Alexander's heirs and a large war chest, though the fact that he was a Greek and not a Macedonian was a major handicap. Antigonus fielded 28,000 infantry and 11,000 horse. Eumenes' force of 35,000 foot and 6,000 horse included the veteran Silver Shields, who had fought with distinction in all of Alexander's campaigns. The battle opened with Antigonus' light horse attacking Eumenes' right. This attack was wrecked by Eumenes' heavy cavalry. Meanwhile in the center, the Silver Shields drove back Antigonus' phalanx. Antigonus' army was on the ropes when he pulled off a stroke that evened the score. He charged through a gap and was successful in routing Eumenes' left flank. Both sides at this point were exhausted and returned to their camps. Antigonus claimed victory, but realistically the battle was a draw and a final resolution would not be reached until the armies met at Gabiene, a year later.</p>

"Hydaspes - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Having gained control over all of the known civilized world, Alexander ventured into India in 326 BC. He met resistance from Porus at the River Hydaspes. Porus' large corps of 200 elephants thwarted all of Alexander's attempts to cross the river. Learning that a large force was moving to reinforce Porus, Alexander decisively divided his army and secretly crossed up-river with the majority of the Macedonian troops, leaving a large detachment in place to deceive the Indians. Upon receiving the startling news that Alexander had crossed the Hydaspes, Porus hurriedly turned his army to meet him in battle. Porus sent his chariots forward but these were quickly destroyed. Alexander then sent his cavalry to attack Porus' rigt wing and gained the flank of the Indian army, while his heavy infantry advanced to attack the elephants and bowmen. The elephants charged the phalanx and did great execution among the elite Macedonian infantry. Only the timely intervention of the light troops prevented a greater loss. Porus, wounded six times, was captured and the remainder of his army routed. Porus so impressed Alexander with his bravery that he was allowed to retain his kingdom as a Macedonian vassal. The power of the elephants was not lost upon the Macedonian generals who fought at Hydaspes. They would go to great pains to obtain elephants of their own during the Wars of the Successors.</p>

"Gaugamela - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Rather that pursue Darius after the victory at Issus (333), Alexander turned south to neutralize the Persian fleet. In a two-year campaign he captured Type and Gaza and conquered Egypt. In 331, Alexander marched into Mesopotamia, intent on attacking Babylon. Darius had raised another army, strong in cavalry but lacking in good infantry. The two armies met on the plain of Gaugamela. Darius posted cavalry on the right and the left and occupied the center with his Greek mercenaries, guard cavalry, elephants, and chariots. Alexander placed the Thessalian horse on the left, gave Craterus the phalanx in the center, and placed himself in person with the Companions on the right. The Persian line extended well beyond both flanks of the Macedonian formation. To counter, Alexander moved diagonally as he advanced, refusing his left. Darius ordered his mounted troops forward. The Macedonian right managed to hold their attackers just long enough for Alexander to charge with his Companions and heavy infantry straight for Darius. As he has at Issus, Darius turned and fled the field but the battle was not yet over. The Macedonian left was still hard pressed by the Persian cavalry. Alexander wheeled about and charged with the Companions into the Persian cavalry, forcing them back. Soon the entire Persian army was in retreat. Gaugamela is one of the truly decisive battles of history and marked the beginning of Alexander's great empire. This battle is also considered the classic example of penetration tactics.</p>

"Crimissos River - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>The Carthaginians learned from earlier defeats in Sicily that they had to field reliable, trained heavy infantry of their own. They formed the Sacred Band, a force of about 2500 excellently trained Carthaginians, as good or better than anything the Greeks of Syracusans could field. The Sacred Band formed part of a large army under Hasdrubal, advancing eastward to subjugate Sicily. Opposing him with a much smaller army was the able tactician Timoleon. Ever aggressive, Timoleon anxiously awaited an opportunity to strike the Carthaginians a hard blow on his terms. He got that chance when, on a foggy morning, Hasdrubal carelessly ordered his army to cross the Crimissos River without bothering to send out scouts (who would have reported that Timoleon's army was arrayed on the bluffs just beyond the river). Waiting until about half of the Carthaginian army had crossed, Timoleon unleashed his excellent heavy infantry phalanx against the surprised Carthaginians. Most who survived fled, but the Sacred Band stood their ground and were annihilated by superior numbers, (aided by a sudden rainstorm that slowed Carthaginian reinforcements crossing the river). Seeing the disaster unfolding across the river, the remainder of Hasdrubal's army broke and fled. The loss of so many citizen soldiers had a horrific effect on Carthage. The Sacred Band was reformed, but only once was it ever dispatched from Africa again, and then only for a very short campaign. Carthage would try to make do with mercenary troops as much as possible on Sicily, which had large repercussions at the end of the First Punic War.</p>

"Plataea - Command and Colors" {

  <p>The Persian emperor Xerxes I led a massive invasion of Greece to avenge the defeat of his father's forces at Marathon. After annihilating the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, Xerxes burned Athens, then Macedon, Thessaly, and Boeotia submitted. However, following the loss of the Persian fleet at Salamis, Xerxes withdrew to Asia and left Mardonius with most of the Persian land forces to continue the subjugation of Greece. Amid much bickering, an allied Greek army was formed under the Spartan Pausanias, and moved to oppose the Persians. The Greeks were always careful to stay in terrain that negated the Persian cavalry, so the Persian cavalry turned to raiding... poisoning the Greek's water supply and destroying a large Greek baggage train. Short of water and food, Pausanias ordered a night withdrawal, but only the allies in the center did so. The Spartan right and Athenian left stood until first light. Seeing this confusion, Mardonius ordered a general advance, although Artabazus, in command of the reserve, suspected a trick and held back. Mardonis attacked the entire Greek line, with an onslaught that was particularly fierce on the Athenian wing. On the right, the Spartans held back until Pausanias obtained just the right "omens" from a sacrifice and then ordered them to charge. It was a desperate infantry battle but the better tactics and weapons of the Greeks finally turned the tide, killing Mardonius along the way. Artabazus managed an orderly retreat back to Asia Minor (he was rewarded with a hereditary satrapy), but the victory at Plataea meant the Persian threat to Greece was effectively ended.</p>

"Marathon - Command and Colors" {

  <p>King Darius I of Persia sent an expedition against Athens in reprisal for the burning of Sardes in 498 BC during the failed Ionian Revolt. The Persian fleet under the joint command of Datis and Artaphernes landed near Marathon bay, which offered a perfect battleground for their troops. The Athenians marched out to face the enemy in the field, with 1000 allied soldiers from Plataea supplementing the Athenian force of 9000. The Persians outnumbered the Greek, but to counter the disparity, Callimachus extended the Greek line to match the enemy, thinning the center while keeping both wings at full strength. The Persian army, with its best troops in the center, was taken by surprise when the Athenians attacked. Historians suggest that the some of the Persian cavalry was in the process of embarking back onto the ships when the attack started (it appears that the Greeks had waited for days before actually lining up for battle). In the battle the Persian center got the best of the weak Greek center and broke through, but this success was more than countered by the defeat of their two wings. The victorious Athenians then swung inwards and the Persian force was routed back to their ships. Concerned that the defeated Persians might still sail around to threaten Athens. Callimachus marched the Greek army back to Athens in "record time." (which is the true "Marathon race.") When the Persian ships reached Athens, they found an army waiting for them on Phaleron beach. Greece was safe, for now.</p>

  <p>Carthage is on the verge of defeat. Spain has been lost, Scipio has landed in Africa and beaten a large, but inexperienced, Carthaginian army at the Battle of the Great Plains. Masinissa has taken his vaunted Numidian light horse over to the Roman side. Hannibal is recalled from Italy, and hurriedly builds an army around the veterans he has brought with him. He creates a corps of war elephants and fields more infantry than does Scipio, but his arm of decision, his cavalry, is far weaker and less capable.</p><p>When the armies meet on the plains of Zama, Hannibal knows his cavalry on the flanks will be beaten, but stakes all on crushing the Roman center with his elephants and infantry before the victorious Roman and Numidian cavalry return from pursuing the Carthaginian horse. Scipio, knowing he is outnumbered, masses his legions in the center and fully intends for Masinissa and the cavalry to complete the encirclement and win the battle.</p><p>As the battle gets underway, both plans are working. The Carthaginian cavalry is driven quickly from the field while the Romans are pressed to keep their lines intact against the elephants and Carthaginian infantry. The flexible legions prove their worth as reserve lines move quickly to secure flanks or bolster the center. In te end Scipio's plan prevails. The Roman and Numidian cavalry return, the Carthaginian army is surrounded, and the valiant infantry is destroyed.</p><p>Scipio had perfected a better tactical system, and that system won at Zama over the legendary Hannibal. The rigid, but powerful phalanx, dominant for so long, had been beaten by the flexibility of Scipio's legions combined with cavalry. The baton of military supremacy had passed to Rome.</p>

  <p>Hasdrubal's departure to join Hannibal in Italy left only two Carthaginian armies in Spain under mediocre commanders (Hasdrubal - yes another one, and Mago). Scipio made steady progress against them, securing territory and prompting many Spanish tribes to come over to the Roman side. Forced to give battle or give up Spain, their most valuable province, the Carthaginian armies united and took up position on the plains outside of Ilipa.</p><p>For three days both armies deployed with their heavy infantry in the center and light troops on each wing. Scipio assumed that the Carthaginians would continue to deploy in this manner and he was correct. On the fourth day, Hasdrubal again deployed his army with the heavies in the center. Scipio this day sent light troops and cavalry to attack the Carthaginian camp and only after the Roman light screen retired did Hasdrubal see the Romans deployed with legionary infantry in both wings and Spanish troops plus lights in the center. The Roman cavalry and legions advanced and began to destroy both Carthaginian light wings. Hasdrubal was unable to send his heavies to support the wings for fear he would open a hole in the center that the Romans would pour through.</p><p>Both Carthaginian wings disintegrated and it looked grim for the heavies in the center until a providential thunderstorm allowed some of them to escape. The combined Carthaginian army was destroyed as a fighting force, and Spain now belonged to Rome. Scipio later crossed into Africa where his victories at The Great Plains and Zama would earn him the title "Africanus".</p>

"Arausio - Command and Colors" {
  10630
  <p>Following the Punic Wars, Rome set out to consolidate the territories it had captured beyond the Alps. At the same time, a major migration by the Cimbri, Teutons, and Ambrones, under the Kings Boiorix and Teutobod, was moving south, reportedly with over 200,00 men (more likely the fighters numbered about 50,000). Two Roman armies were sent to stop this migration with nearly 80,000 legionnaires. However, bitter differences between the Consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus and the Proconsul Quintus Servillius Caepio prevented the two Roman armies from cooperating, with devastating results. The Roman forces were camped by the Rhone River, near Arausio (modern Orange). However, the armies did not camp together. Caepio made his camp closer to the enemy (seeking to rob Maximus of the victory) and his dispositions are shown on the battlefield (Maximus and his army have made camp off map). The sight of two Roman armies made Boiorix cautios, and he entered into negotiations with Maximus. Caepio, motivated by hatred and envy of Maximus, foolishly launched a hasty attack on the barbarians. Caepio's army was annihilated in this piecemeal assault. With a boost in confidence from this easy victory, the barbarians proceeded to advance, pin Maximus' army against the river, and destroy it also. In terms of human lives lost, Arausio was among the most lethal battles in world history, and Rome's worst defeat since Cannae. The terrible defeat had one beneficial result for Rome. It gave Gaius Marius the opportunity to come to the fore and radically reform the organization and recruitment of Rome's legions.</p>

  <p>After Cannae, Rome struggled to rebuild its armies, but needed time. In Spain, Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal commanded an army large enough to possibly let Carthage win the war - if it united with Hannibal's victorious veterans. Standing in his way, however, were the legions of two capable (at last) consuls, the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Scipio. Both knew of the tactics used at Cannae, but felt the only way to counter encirclement was to quickly break the Carthaginian center. When the battle commenced, the Roman legions fiercely attacked the Carthaginian center, but, unlike Cannae, there was enough Roman cavalry to hold their flanks. Lacking cavalry superiority (and his brother's tactical genius), Hasdrubal was unable to surround the Romans before they broke through his center. His cavalry joined the retreat, leaving the splendid heavy infantry to its fate. Rome was granted the time it needed to live and fight another day. Eight years later, Hasdrubal finally was able to march to Italy, but lost both his army and his life at the Metaurus.</p>

After a bloody contest, only three men remained, two Argives and one Spartan. The Argives claimed victory because of their numerical superiority and returned to their army. The Spartan also claimed victory, since their man was the last on the battlefield. The Argives sent their entire Hoplite army forward to settle the argument. An equally determined Spartan army met them. After heavy losses on both sides, the Spartans emerged victorious.</p>

The Persian cavalry attacked anyway, but their commander Masistias was killed. Ceasing direct combat, the Persian cavalry began raiding effectively, poisoning the Greek's water supply and destroying a large Greek baggage train. Short of water and food, Pausanias ordered a night withdrawal, but only the allies in the center did so. The Spartan right and Athenian left were both still standing fast at first light. Mardonius ordered an advance to exploit his perceived advantage, and attacked the Athenian units on the Greek left wing. It was a fierce onslaught that prevented the Athenians from moving to assist the Spartans who were being pressed hard on the right. Holding back until the omens were right, the Spartans were finally ordered to charge, routing all before them and killing Mardonius. The sight of Persians retreating unnerved Artabazus'forces and they also fled the field. The victory at Plataea meant the Persian threat to Greece was effectively ended.</p>

"CnC-A 0617 - Mycale" {
  10630
  <p>In the spring of 479 BC, various Ionian cities began a revolt against their Persian rulers, and soon were forced to turn to the Greek mainland for help. A meeting was called in Athens, and a Greek fleet of 110 ships set sail from Delos under the command of the Spartan King Leotychides. The Persians, no longer confident after the crushing naval defeat at Salamis, dismissed their Phoenician naval contingent and moved the remainder of the fleet to Mycale, where they joined forces with the army that Xerxes had led back to Asia. The Greeks expected a naval battle, but when they approached the Persian camp, they found the ships beached and the Persian army in combat formation. The Athenians, under Xanthippus, landed on the beach and during their advance found a herald's scepter. Believing it was a divine sign that the Greeks had been victorious at Plataea, they charged forward without the Spartans. The Spartans had landed at another site and were still marching around the flank through the hills. The Persians repelled the Athenian assaults for a time, but eventually the Athenians manage to burst through to the Persian camp. The battle continued with no side certain of victory until the arrival of the Spartans, and the desertion of the Ionian Greeks, who joined in the attack on the Persians. The Persian army turned and fled to the mountains. Mycale ended the Persian Wars and the Greek cities in Asia were accepted into a league with Athens.</p>

"CnC-A 0618 - Tanagra" {
  10630
  <p>The First Peleponnesian War (460-445 BC) broke out due to Megara's defection from the Spartan alliance, and Spartan envy and fear over the growth of the Athenian Empire. Nicomedes marched an army into Boeotia in 457 BC to intervene in a dispute between the Dorians and Phocians. He forced the Phocians to accept terms, but while he was in Doris an Athenian Fleet moved into position to block his return across the Corinthian Gulf. Athens, then sent out an army to meet the Spartans, and the two forces meet outside Tanagra. The Athenians brought a large contingent of Hoplites supplemented by a number of allies. The total number given by Thucydides is 14,000 plus a small contingent of Thessalian cavalry. The allied Spartan army consisted of 1,500 Spartans and 10,000 allied soldiers. According to Thucydides, the Thessalian cavalry joined the Spartan side during the battle, and the Spartans and their allies wore down and broke the Athenians. Both armies suffered heavy losses, but the Spartans won the battle and opened the way back home. This was the first major land battle of the war and began a pattern of Spartan dominance on land.</p>

"CnC-A 0619 - Olpae" {
  10630
  <p>During the Second, or Great, Peleponnesian War (431 - 404 BC) the Athenians recognized their inferiority to Sparta in land warfare, and chose to fight with proxy forces and at sea. Nevertheless, there were many small battles, and the clash at Olpae is representative. In 426, the Spartan general Eurylochus was operating in western Greece with a small force of Hoplites. He convinced the Ambraciots to invade Amphilokia, and their forces joined him at Olpae. in response, the Amphilokians called on their allies and the nearby Athenian fleet under Demosthenes. Demosthenes only had a small force, but was chosen to be the strategos, or commander, of the allied army. Eurylochus deployed with his Peleponnesians on the left and Ambraciots on the right. Demosthenes countered with his Messenians on the right, Arcanians in the center and Amphilokians on the left. Seeing that his army was badly outnumbered, Demosthenes extended his left wing with light troops and posted a picket force in hiding to ambush the Spartan right. When the lines clashed, Demosthenes sprung his ambush and routed the Peleponnesians, killing Eurylochus. Meanwhile, the Ambraciots also routed the Athenian left, but Demosthenes was able to keep his victorious wing in good order and attacked these troops, completing his victory. This victory recharged Demoshtenes' career, but gained little for Athens.</p>

  <p>After the Battle of Pylos, a force of Spartan soldiers was isolated on the island of Sphacteria. Demosthenes,commanding the force at Pylos, initially planned to starve the Spartans out, but it became clear over time that the Spartans would be able to hold out. He requested reinforcements from Athens. Cleon, with an Athenian expeditionary force, landed and moved inland, harassing the Spartans with missile fire whenever they attempted to advance to battle. The frustrated Spartans withdrew to the northern end of the island, where they waited behind their fortifications.A stalemate took place for some time, until an Athenian force burst into the Spartan rear using a route along the island's shore that had been left unguarded because of its roughness. The Spartans abandoned their defenses after Epitadas, their commander, was killed. Styphon, now in command, ordered his surrounded men to throw down their shields and surrender. The mystique of Spartan invincibility was shattered.</p>

  <p>In 424 BC, the Spartan general Brasidas led an army toward Thrace to threaten the only accessible part of the Athenian Empire. He reached Thrace and offered generous terms to the people of Amphipolis, who surrendered without a fight. In 423 BC, Athens and Sparta signed a truce, hoping to exchange Amphipolis for the Spartan hostages of Sphacteria, but Brasidas, against the wishes of the Spartan regime, continued to support the rebellion in the area. Athens ended the truce and sent Cleon with an army to recover Amphipolis. Brasidas would not emerge from the city for battle. Frustrated by the apparent Spartan timidity, Cleon began to move his troops back to Eion. Brasidas waited till the Athenian left wing marched past the South Gate, and with his best men charged out of the city, while Clearidas, his subordinate, emerged from the Thracian Gate with the rest of the Spartan army. The Athenians on the left wing fled to Eion, while those on the right fought bravely against Clearidas. Cleon was killed during the battle, and Brasidas mortally wounded. Athens agreed to stop the war and signed the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC. Sparta recovered their hostages and Athens the towns captured by Brasidas. Both sides would have time to prepare for the final phase of the war.</p>

  <p>Ironically, the greates Hoplite battle of the Peleponnesian War was fought during the Peace of Nicias (421 - 415). Athens was able to forge an anti-Spartan coalition. King Agis II of Sparta marched out to seek a decisive battle. The Spartan army numbered about 12,000 Hoplites, while the Argive coalition had 11,000. At first, the Argive army avoided combat, but when Agis emerged from a forest, he was surprised to find the Argive army drawn up close by for battle. Agis hastily deployed, placing about 1,000 Spartans on the right, in support of his 3,000 Tegeans. He commanded 5,000 Spartans in the center, surrounded by his personal bodyguard of 300 hippeis. On the left were the 600 skiritae (Spartan rangers) and 2,000 freed helots. The coalition countered with 3,500 Mantineans and allies on their right. In the center were the elite "Argive 1,000" and 5,000 regular Argives. Their left was held by Laches with Athenian cavalry and allies. As the battle began, Agis gave orders to fill the gap in his line, but there was no time and the Argive right wing quickly enveloped and routed the Spartan left. Meanwhile, Agis led a furious assault in the center shattering the Argive phalanx. The Athenian left collapsed. Agis kept his army under control, wheeled, and assaulted the Mantineans to complete his victory. The anti-Spartan alliance was crushed and Sparta would enter the final phase of the Peleponnesian War in a position of strength.</p>

"CnC-A 0624 - Anapus River" {
  10630
  <p>In 415 BC Athens and Sparta were still under the Peace of Nicias, when the Sicilian city of Segesta requested help from Athens in their war against Selinus. Some Athenians saw this as an opportunity to take over all of Sicily,Syracuse, and even Carthage. Against his wishes, Nicias was elected general to lead the Sicilian Expedition. The Athenians used a double agent to trick the Syracusan army into marching to Catana, and when they took the bait, landed unopposed south of the Anapus River. There they took up a strong defensive position. When the Syracusans returned and found the Athenians waiting, they made camp for the night, intending to fight the next day. The Athenians, in a surprise move, attacked at dawn across the river. The unprepared Syracusan soldiers formed up as best they could in the short time before the Athenian force made contact. The Athenians used the river to guard their left as they advanced, and placed their light troops on the wings to fight off the Syracusan cavalry. Despite the greater depth of the Syracusan phalanx, the superior discipline and experience of the Athenians carried the day. However, they could not undertake an aggressive pursuit and score a decisive victory due to the lack of cavalry. It was a tactical victory without a strategic result. The Athenians sailed back to Catana for the winter, while the Syracusans prepared fot a siege and sent to Corinth and Sparta for help.</p>

  <p>Following Athens' defeat in the Peleponnesian War, the victorious Spartans imposed an oligarchic government on the city which became known as the Thirty Tyrants. Late in 404, Thrasybulus, leading a force of Athenian exiles, gathered at Phyle near Mount Parnes. The Thirty Tyrants, to keep watch on the exiles and prevent them from raiding the countryside, dispatched a Spartan force from Athens. The Spartan force was not expecting any trouble and set up camp. However, Thrasybulus, whose force of exiles had grown in numbers, attacked the Spartan camp. The attack caught the Spartan force in the midst of waking up and a total rout ensued. The defeated Spartans fled back to Athens and the victorious exiles returned to Phyle.</p>

The new government sent emissaries to Sparta, and Sparta sent Pausanias at the head of an army to resolve the situation. When Pausanias ordered the exiles to disperse, they refused. The following day, an Athenian exile force of light troops attacked the Spartans. Pausanias responded and ordered his cavalry and light troops forward with his Spartan Hoplites in support. The Athenian lights held for a time, giving Thrasybulus the opportunity to bring forward his Hoplites. The Spartan Hoplites engaged them and the exiles were defeated. After winning the battle, Pausanias suggested the government in Athens and the exiles talk. In time, the new government arranged a settlement between the oligarchs and the exiles that reunified Athens.</p>

Xenophon led an organized retreat through Carducia and Armenia toward the Black Sea, constantly harassed first by Persian armies and then by local tribes. Using part of his men, Xenophon created a small cavalry force and a body of archers to meed the tactics of the enemy. He reported the whole expedition in his Anabasis. Approaching the River Centrites, Xenophon found that the satrap of Armenia had occupied the far bank. The situation was desparate, but the next morning a better ford higher up the river was found, and to it the Spartans marched. The Carducians followed closely in pursuit. Cheirisophus began to cross, while Xenophon, made a feint to move back to the lower ford. The Armenians responded to the feint, which allowed Cheirisophus to gain a foothold on the other shore. Xenophon retraced his steps and made preparations to follow. The Carducians, saw their opportunity and began to attack the Greeks before they could cross. When most of the troops were over, Xenophon turned and charged the Carducians and they were dispersed. Then, before they could recover, he retired Trapezus, on the Black Sea. A few years later, Alexander would read the Anabasis and follow Xenophon's advice: Persia belongs to the man who has the courage to attack it...</p>

Aristodemus was sent north to challenge the alliance and the two armies met neat the dry riverbed of Nemea. The Spartan army fielded about 18,000 Hoplites and lined up with the Spartans on the right and their Peleponnesian allies on the left. The coalition forces were made up of about the same number of Hoplites with the Athenians opposite the Spartans, while the Boeotians were on the right of the coalition line. As the lines advanced, both lines shifted to the right and when the two met each line extended past the opponents left flank, which meant that both right flanks overlapped the enemy line and were victorious. The Spartans, instead of pursuing the Athenians, quickly turned to the center and defeated the other coalition forces one by one.</p>

After successfully leading his force well past the city of Corinth, the Spartan commander ordered his Hoplites to return to Lechaeum, while the cavalry continued on with the Amyclaeans. Iphicrates, who commanded the light troops in Corinth, seeing that the Spartan Hoplite force was unprotected by light infantry or cavalry, decided to attack the Spartans as they marched past the city. The Spartan commander ordered some of his men to charge the Athenians, but the slow heavily-armed Hoplites could not make contact. When the Spartans turned to return to their lines, the Athenian lights fell upon them again flinging spears, and inflicting casualties. This process was repeated several times, with similar results. Unable to drive off the Athenians, the Spartans were forced back to the hills which proved to be a bitter blow to Spartan pride.</p>

  <p>In 379 BC, an insurrection ejected the Spartan garrison at Thebes, and the city set about reestablishing its control over the Boeotian League. After several years, the Thebans succeeded in driving Spartan garrisons out of every city in Boeotia, except Orchomenus. In 375 BC, Pelpidas set out with the Sacred Band and a small force of cavalry to seize Orchomenus. However, learning that a sizable force had been dispatched from Sparta to reinforce the garrison there, Pelopidas retreated. Before the Thebans could reach safety, they encountered the Spartan reinforcements. The Spartan fielded over 1,000 men; the Thebans, only 300. Plutarch reports that one Theban soldier, upon seeing the enemy force, said to Pelopidas "We are fallen into our enemies' hands", to which he replied "And why not they into ours?" Pelopidas then ordered the Theban cavalry to charge, while the infantry formed up into a dense formation. When the two forces came together, the compact Theban formation broke through the Spartan line and then turned to attack the Spartans to either side. The Spartan force broke and fled. The Theban victory had little immediate military significance. However, it marked the first occasion on which a Spartan formation had been defeated by a force of equal of lesser size in a set battle.</p>

"CnC-A 0633 - Leuctra" {
  10630
  <p>Sparta's victory over Athens in the Peleponnesian War (431 - 404) cemented the reputation of her hoplites as the premier infantry force in the world. However, Spartan arrogance following this victory led to the outbreak of hostilities with their former ally, Thebes. In 371 King Cleombrotos of Sparta marched against Thebes. When he reached Leuctra he found the Thegan army barred his way. The Spartans deployed in a long line with their allies on the left. Greek commanders traditionally placed their best troops on the right, and this wing usually led the attack. The brilliant Theban commander, Epaminondas, devised an innovative plan to mass his best men on the left in a 50-man deep phalanx. He intended to use this mass to break through the famed Spartan phalanx. Both sides sent their cavalry out and the Spartan horse were quickly defeated. Seeing his cavalry fail, Cleombrotos ordered his infantry to advance. Simultaneously, Epaminondas' massed left advanced against the Spartan right, while the rest of his army was ordered to hold back, in an oblique order. The Spartans were attempting to change formation to deal with the situation when the Sacred Band charged and hit them in mid-maneuver. Cleombrotos was killed and the massive weight of the Theban phalanx broke the Spartan line. Never before had Sparta experienced such a significant defeat, and Leuctra ended the era of Spartan military invincibility.</p>

"CnC-A 0634 - Mantinea" {
  10630
  <p>Thebes' shocking victory at Leuctra in 371 had ended the Spartan hegemony over Greece. Epimondas then organized the Arcadian League of cities in the Peleponnesus, in order to counter-balance Sparta and ensure Theban supremacy. A division in the Arcadian league led Mantinea to ally with Sparta. Sparta's hereditary enemy, Athens, even joined in the alliance against Thebes. Epaminondas invaded in 362 to reassert Theban dominance. In a plain near Mantinea he encountered the enemy force of 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse with the Mantineans on the right, Spartans in the center, and Athenians on the left. Epaminondas' force of 30,000 foot and 3,000 horse was deployed with massive depth on his left, the same tactic he had used successfully at Leuctra. The Thebans closed in on the Mantinean wing and then grounded arms as if not to battle this day. Once the Mantineans relaxed their guard, Epaminondas suddenly ordered the attack. The onslaught broke the Mantinean right flank, leading to the defeat of the entire Spartan army. Disastrously for Thebes, Epaminondas was killed in the closing moments of the battle. Sparta had been humbled again, but without her brilliant leader, Thebes was unable to maintain her hegemony over Greece. The ultimate result was a weakening of Greece that paved the way for the Macedonian conquest.</p>

"CnC-A 0635 - Chaeronea" {
  10630
  <p>Philip II gained the throne of Macedon in 359 BC and re-organized his army into a combined arms force. He then set on a long diplomatic and military campaign to dominate the Greek city-states. In 338, Athens and Thebes allied and took up a position at Chaeronea. Philip soon arrived to accept the challenge. Both armies numbered about 30,000 men. The Athenians were on the left under Chares, allies held the center, the Thebans stood on the right under Theagenes and the Sacred Band held the extreme right. Philip commanded the Macedonian right wing, placed his heavy phalanx in the center, and allies and mercenaries on the left with his son Alexander and the Companion Cavalry. Philip began the battle by withdrawing his right wing, provoking an advance by the Athenians. The Thebans advanced next and began to make headway, but Alexander led a furious cavalry charge and surrounded the Sacred Band. Meanwhile Philip ended his feigned retreat and assaulted the Athenians, who quickly broke. Once the Sacred Band had been eliminated, Alexander rolled up the Theban flank completing the Macedonian victory. Following this battle, nearly all the Greek cities (save Sparta) were forced to join the League of Corinth and accept Macedonian hegemony.</p>

"CnC-A 0636 - Megalopolis" {
  10630
  <p>Sparta had stood on the sidelines while Athens and Thebes battled Macedon at Chaeronea. As the Macedonian army plunged ever deeper into Asia, King Agis III sensed an opportunity to regain the hegemony of Greece for Sparta. Agis began secret negotiations with the Persians and obtained funding for a rebellion. in 331 the Macedonian army was stretched thin - Alexander was advancing into Mesopotamia, Antigonus was fighting an insurrection in Phrygia and Antipater, the strategos of Europe, was quelling a revolt in Thrace. Agis chose this opportune moment to attack Megalopolis, but Antipater quickly subdued the Thracians and headed south to face the upstart Spartans. Agis commanded 20,000 foot and 2,000 cavalry while Antipater had about 30,000 men. Agis's numerical inferiority convinced Agis to lift the siege and maneuver to a constricted battlefield. When the two armies clashed, Agis's Spartans broke through the Macedonian line at first, and his mercenaries drove back their opponents. Antipater brought up his reserves and stabilized his line. There was fierce fighting around the Spartan king and when Agis was slain, his army collapsed. The power of Sparta was broken for a century, and Alexander's home base was secure as he headed further east.</p>

"CC-E 0021 - Saint Agatha" {
  21050
  <p>Northern Siciliy&mdash;While elements of the 15th and 30th Infantry Regiments of the US 9th Division seized a key hill along San Fratello Line, Lt. Col. Lyle Bernard led a reinforced Battalion in an amphibious landing at Sant' Agata, a few miles behind San Fratello. This assault force quickly blocked the coastal highway - unfortunately the Germans had already selected that night to withdraw from the area.</p><p>Taking advantage of the constricting terrain and armed with a plethora of mines, General Hube deftly withdrew XIV Panzer Corps toward Messina. As the American forces pursued, however, they came upon innumerable blocking forces - both German and Italian - at every twist and turn of the narrow roads cutting through the rough Sicilian countryside.</p>

  <p>South of Goch, Holland&mdash;Operation Veritable - Montgomery's push to the Rhine - was encountering fanatic German resistance for every square mile of Holland. Having just about secured the town of Goch, the 1st Gordon Highlanders were ordered to continue the advance south and east. The next obstacle for Company A turned out to be the hamlet of Thomashof: a gathering of stone buildings and farmland interlaced with wire fences. The German defenders enjoyed both wide fields of fire and the element of surprise as the "Spandaus" - the British nickname fot the German MG42 machine gun - opened up...</p>

  <p>Southern Desert, Egypt&mdash;Unaware of the preparations being made by Rommel's Afrika Korps for an attack later in the month, life in the Italian trenches along the Alam Halfa Line was hot, dusty and boring, and punctuated by timely British artillery attacks every two hours around the clock.</p><p>On the morning of the 11th of August it was discovered that, during the previous night, a British sniper team had apparently infiltrated to an abandoned truck in no-man's land. One unlucky Italian sentry had already suffered the ultimate fate so an 81mm mortar was called forward to deal with the intruders.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Front, Lanzerath, Germany&mdash;Regimental Order No. 54 was given to the 1st Company, 9th Regiment of the 3rd Fallschirmjäger Division: The unit was instructed to clear Lanzerath and other villages in and around the Losheim Gap of enemy resistance. This was to prepare the way for Joachim Peiper's 1st SS Panzer Division, recently outfitted with 30 King Tigers, to storm through the front without delay.</p><p>As US soldiers were needed to defend this lightly held area, an Intelligence &amp; Recon platoon of 18 men - trained to be the "eyes and ears" of a division - belonging to the American 394th Regiment, 99th Division, was placed on the front line near the small hamlet of Lanzerath which overlooked Losheim further east. Their orders were to observe the area and provide warning of enemy action.</p><p>From the woods looking down a gently sloping snow-covered field leading down to Lanzerath, these men had improved their positions with overlapping logs, creating a solid defensive bunker with good fields of fire.</p><p>As a German column was seen marching through Lanzerath, a young girl ran out of a house and approached a German officer. Speaking excitedly while pointing in the I&amp;R platoon's general direction, the German commander barked an order and the troops dive for the ditches lining the road. Lt. Bouck yelled to "Open fire!" and the Battle of the Bulge began for this handful of men.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Front, Lanzerath, Germany&mdash;After a pause to tend to the wounded, the German paratroopers launched another attack on the American positions along the woodline above Lanzerath. Lieutenant Bouck again called for artilley support and was again denied due to more pressing concerns elsewhere. When he asked what he should do without artillery support the reply was succinct: "hold at all costs". Shortly thereafter, an enemy fire attack pierced the radio,destroying it.</p><p>Despite the morning's intense fighting, only one American soldier had been wounded, having been hit in the face by a rifle grenade that luckily failed to explode as it fell to the ground.</p><p>As the afternoon attacks across the open fields continued, the lack of sleep from the previous night and dwindling ammunition supplies began to take its toll on the vastly outnumbered American defenders. In the end they held out for 18 hours before being outflanked - effectively crippling a good portion of the 3rd Fallschirmjäger's manpower while allowing critical time for the US Army to reposition itself in order to meed the Germans' main thrust.</p><p>Because of their actions during that first morning of what would later be called "The Battle of the Bulge" this group of brave men became the most decorated platoon of WWII.</p>

Expecting a counter-attack from the north, 3/505 Commander Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort orders D Company's 3rd Platoon - led by 1st Lt. Turner Turnbull - to block Route D-15 at Neuville-au-Plain. Shortly after arriving, Turnbull's force of 43 men spot a large column of men in feldgrau approaching down the highway, apparently escorted by soldiers wearing American paratroopers' uniform. Wary of a ruse, an American machine-gunner fires warning shots into a nearby field. The German "prioners" dive for the ditches.</p><p>After fanning out in either direction in order to try and outflank the outnumbered but well-entrenched Americans, the German attack commences.</p>

Lt. Col. Robert Cole's 3/502 PIR (101st Airborne), supported by artillery and mortar fire, was tasked with assaulting Carentan from the north across a narrow causeway over marshy ground along the river. As the Americans approached the outskirts of Carentan, German Fallschirmjäger opened up with machine guns and rifle fire from positions in nearby hedgerows and farmhouses.</p>

Robert Cole's 3/502 PIR (101st Airborne) charged across open ground and established themselves around an abandoned farmhouse near the Madeleine Canal. Reinforced by elements of Lt. Col. Patrick Cassidy's 2/502 PIR during a lull in the fighting, they braced themselves for a counterattack by the German 6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment. American mortar ammo was gone, the radio link to divisional artillery support jammed. As the paratroopers caught their breath, the rising clatter of machine-gun and small arms fire from down among the hedgerows heralded the German attack.</p>

  <p>Bastogne, Belgium&mdash;The isolated 101st Airborne seemed to be surviving on courage alone. By Christmas, they were running low on food, medicine, fuel and heavy ammunition. A plan was devised to re-supply them from the air. Fifty gliders towed by C47 cargo planes took off from France and headed for Bastogne. Not knowing which side controlled the landing zones, the brave glider pilots cast off their tow lines, flew through intense anti-aircraft fire, and landed with their volatile cargo. German and American troops poured out of their foxholes to capture the gliders and their contents.</p>

  <p>Mindanao Island, Philippines&mdash;After capturing Libby Airfield with the aid of Filipino guerrillas, the US 24th Infantry Division found the assault toward Davao becoming exceedingly slow and ponderous. Exacerbating the issue was the preponderance of hemp fields in the area, now very much overgrown with disuse. Traversing these unkempt fields was slow going at best. Japanese forces of the 100th Division, however, found these numerous plantations extremely useful for hiding defensive strongpoints. Guerrillas continued to aid the Americans in their push toward Davao, and in one particularly nasty firefight on the 7th of May actually proved decisive in overcoming a Japanese bunker that was covering a major trail break through the area.</p>

Along the way, scouts were surprised to discover a ragged - and apparently lost - column of Japanese troops advancing down a jungle path. Calvert ordered his weary survivors into ambush formations around a small village where their road and the enemy trail intersected.</p>

During what is known as the Battle of Tenaru River, by 0030, Colonel Ichiki had maneuvered his force into position and ordered some covering fire across the river. Since minor patrols with small enemy parties were a nightly occurrence, the fire did not raise significant alarm among the defenders. At 0200 Ichiki ordered 2nd company of the Japanese II/28th Regiment to charge across the sandbar of the Ilu River (known as Alligator Creek to the US Marines). The goal was to push past the defensive perimeter and on to Henderson Field. Facing them were the US Marines of G Company of the II/1st Regiment and two platoons of the 1st Special Weapons Battalion. The shrieking attackers came across the river without cease, but the defenders held their nerve and their ground.</p>

Empress Augusta Bay had been chosen because it was within range of allied land-based fighter bases and because the Japanese 17th Army was concentrated at other sites around the island. The stretch of beach near Cape Torokina was only "lightly" defended by little more than a company of well-camouflaged Japanese infantry - including a 75mm gun dug-in on the cape that wreaked havoc amongst the landing craft on their long approach to the beach in heavy seas.</p>

A Japanese seaplane base guarded by a citadel of defenses was the key target on Butaritari, a part of the Makin Atol. The 27th Infantry Division Task Force was divided into Regimental Combat Teams with a landing plan to surround the defenders. On D-Day, elements of the 1-165 RCT pushed east with little opposition through flat swampy terrain toward the West Tank Barrier to meet up with the 2-165 forces heading west. In the early afternoon, C Company faced the toughest opposition by the Japanese Construction Force.</p>

"CC-P F - Stalemate" {
  28181
  <p>Peleliu, Palau&mdash;The Japanese unveiled a new defensive approach on Peleliu using well-entrenched positions, extensive caves, and natural barriers across the island. This was developed by Colonel Nakagawa, commander of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the 14th Infantry Division. Prior to the invasion of this strategic island, the defenders withheld all fire to mask their positions from US naval bombardment. This tactic continued on D-Day itself, allowing the three regiments (1st, 5th and 7th) of the 1st Marine Division to reach the beaches under very light fire. But progress inland was slow and with a terrible cost in lives. By the 20th, the 1/1st Marines had reached the base of Hill 154, a barren wall of coral infested with hidden defenders and protected from the overlook knows as Suicide Ridge. Captain Everett Pope led C Company up that wall, fighting valiantly and managing to overtake the position. During the night, the Japanese assaulted the Marines on the hill repeatedly. In between charges, the Marines countered by tossing rocks (to sound like grenade landings) as well as some actual grenades from their dwindling supply. When the Marines finally ran out of ammunition, Captain Pope rallied the few remaining Marines around himself to all fight back the repeated charges with little more than their bare hands.</p>

Elements of the 144th Infantry Regiment (Japanese South Seas Force) fell back upon excellent defensive terrain at the miserable village of Eora, where the Kokoda Trail passed through the gorge formed by the Eora Creek. Elements of the 16th Brigade advanced forward looking to find the strong points, pin them and bypass them. The bitter fighting lasted two days before the Japanese secretly retired from their positions and fell back to Oivi.</p>

General Kawaguchi employed a complicated plan using battalions from the 124th and 4th Infantry. The terrain rendered a multi-pronged plan almost impossible to execute, however, but with sheer willpower, some of his force managed a devastating attack. During what is known as the Battle of Edson's of "Bloody" Ridge, at 2230 7th company of the Japanese II/4th Regiment launched the first of many attacks along the eastern flanks of the ridge directly at B Company of the 1st Parachute Battalion. A successful attack could dislodge or overtake Lt. Colonel Edson's command post and put the defense of Henderson Field in grave jeopardy. Amazingly, Edson orchestrated one of the greatest nighttime defenses and was awarded the Medal of Honor.</p>

During what is known as the Battle of Henderson Field, between 0300 and 0500 elements of the Japanese III/4th Regiment (part of Force Oka to the west of Henderson Field) attacked the US Marines of F Company of II/7th Regiment on the eastern slopes of a saddle-shaped ridge. The attack was massed all along Colonel Hanneken's front, but in particular the Japanese delivered deadly fire from the trees onto the heights of the ridge, eliminating many of the defenders, despite the heroism of Sergeant Mitchell Paige (who was firing weapons from both hands). Although the attackers eventually took the crest of the ridge, in a surprise move, Paige was part of an unlikely counterattack unit made of communications specialists, messmen, bandsmen, a cook and a few other riflemen. They retook the ridge decisively. Fot his singular efforts, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. This fight was part of one of the last major attempts by the Japanese to take the airfield, which ended in failure.</p>

The fighting was up close and personal:</p><p>"Walz's commander, Leutnant Hermann Hennes, helped him into a bomb crater and did his best to bind the nasty wound. When Hennes stood up, he saw enemy soldiers moving towards them, so he grabbed his rifle and lined up a shot. Lying on his back in the crater, Walz looked up at his commander, expecting him to be the first to fire. A shot rang out and Leutnant Hennes' helmet flew off his head: a Soviet sniper had nailed him from the side...

The men of A and B companies of the 2nd East Yorkshire Regiment landed along the French coastline at 0725 hours much to the surprise of the men of WN20. Despite their surprise the grenadiers of the 736th put up a determined resistance (knocking out several British tanks and slowing the advance inland) before being overwhelmed by the invasion forces.</p>

  <p>Authie, Normandy&mdash;After landing at Juno and dashing for its objective of Carpiquet Airfield, 3rd Canadian Division met the counterattack of 12th SS "Hitlerjugend" Panzer Division northwest of Caen. Aided by observation from a nearby abbey tower, the SS caught the advancing Alied Armor in the flank between the outskirt villages of Buron and Authie. North Nova Scotia Highland infantry of Captain Hank Fraser's C Company with machinegunners of the Ottawa Cameron Highlanders had made Authie but had outrun artillery support. Fraser sent his carriers rearward as the first wave of 18-year-old Panzergrenadiers came on to throw the Canadians back into the sea. The vicious close-quarters fight that ensued amid smoke and German shellfire inaugurated a bitter rivalry between the two divisions.</p>

  <p>Utah Beach Vicinity, Normandy&mdash;Fire from the 210mm guns of the Crisbecq Coastal Artillery Battery, commanded by Lw. Walter Ohmsen, constantly harassed and prohibited the unloading of supplies and reinforcements on Utah Beach. On June 7 the 1Bn, 22nd Infantry was tasked with neutralizing the guns. However, the assault faltered when Lt. Ohmsen called fire from the 150mm guns of the nearby Azeville Battery on his own position to drive off the attack. The 1Bn renewed the assault on D-Day plus 2. Led by C Company, organized into special assault groups, the 1Bn very nearly succeeded in eliminating the Crisbecq guns but once again the infantrymen were thwarted by artillery fire from Azeville and a timely counterattack by elements of the 919th Grenadier Regiment.</p>

  <p>Chateau Sainte-Genevieve, Brittany&mdash;Hours before OVERLORD, coded transmissions alerted resistance cells across France - the Forces Francaises de l'Interieur (FFI) - to assemble and hinder the expected movement of German forces toward Normandy. In Brittany, airdropped French commandos joined a major FFI bivouac near Saint-Marcel and began sabotaging rail lines to block Axis reinforcement eastward. British airdrops supplying the FFI camp eventually attracted German attention, and on 18 June local garrison forces massed to flush the partisans out. French SAS Lt. Nicholas Marienne, commanding a sector of the perimeter, found himself in the path of Axis Osttruppen advancing on a chateau they had mistaken for the bivouac's headquarters.</p>

As nightfall approached, the 116th was ordered to halt and consolidate its gains for the day. By the time Maj. Bingham's 2nd Bn. received the order, over half of it had advanced one half mile beyond the support of the 1st and 3rd battalions. Maj. Bingham's 2nd Bn. sat astride the St. Lo - Bayeux highway just east of the village of La Madeleine and was ordered to hold position. During that night, elements of the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regt. quickly cut off Bingham's men. Bingham and his battalion remained isolated for two days, suffering under intense artillery barrages and sporadic small arms fire. On 18 July a renewed assault by 3rd Bn., 116th Inf. managed to break through to the 2nd Bn. The combined 2nd and 3rd Battalions were to launch an immediate attack on St. Lo but, before they could do so, elements of the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regt. with artillery support launched its own assault against the Americans.</p>

  <p>Cheux, Normandy&mdash;The Allied failure to capture Caen on D-Day allowed the Germans to rush reinforcements to the area. In an effort to isolate and pressure the defenses around Caen, Field Marshal Montgomery devised and launched Operation Epsom, spear-headed by the British 43rd and the Scottish 15th Infantry Divisions. At dawn on June 26th men of the 2nd Bn (Scottish 15th Division - as yet not tested in battle) approached the objective - the village of Cheux - which was heavily shrouded in mist and defended by the men of the 12th SS Pionier Bn (rear-echelon troops of the 12th SS Panzer Division). The Highlanders advanced on Cheux following a walking barrage from the 15th Division's artillery. The barrage enabled the Highlanders to penetrate the main line of resistance. Once in the enemy rear it seemed that Cheux would be easily cleared. However, the Highlanders were not prepared for the unexpected stiff resistance. Let by Lt. Bruno Asmus and Lt. Lorenz, the SS HQ and SS Supply troops defended vigorously, forcing the Highlanders to clear Cheux house by house often in hand-to-hand combat.</p>

The initial onslaught was partially successful in penetrating the American lines and the 2nd Bn, 120th Infantry Regiment was surrounded and cut off east of Mortain. The men of E Company commanded by Lt. Ralph Kerley occupied Hill 314 on the right flank of US position. Elements of the 2nd SS Panzer and 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Divisions repeatedly attacked the 2nd Bn positions day and night. Each assault was helped driven off by the accurate on call artillery fire from the 230th FA Bn directed by E Company's FO, Lt. Robert Weiss. On the night of 8 August elements of the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division renewed their assault on Hill 314 successfully penetrating E Company's position. Lt.

  <p>Hill 262, The Falaise Pocket&mdash;After the Allied breakout forced by Operation Cobra, the German army was caught between two pincer movements with most of the Seventh Army trapped in the rapidly closing "Falaise Pocket." The retreating army desperately sought to escape along its last remaining route, the Chambois-Vimoutiers road, which passed before Hill 262. The 1st Polish Armoured Division attached to the 1st Canadian Army was ordered to take the hill (which had previously been invested by the Germans with strong defensive positions) to somehow "close the door." On August 19th, the Polish forces created a devastating ambush on the escaping German forces in the valley below. In desperation, elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division mounted a night assault on the 20th advancing in waves, with the firce support of Tiger tanks. The famous defense led by Polish Major Stefanowicz was inspired - all ammunition was to be used and he uttered the phrase: "Surrender is out of the question!" An attached Canadian artillery observation officer, Captain Sevigny, designed the pre-registered fire for the defense.</p>

"CnC-A 0208 - Clusium" {
  10630
  <p>The Cisalpine Gauls (those living south of the Alps) had sacked Rome in 390 BC and fought intermittently with Rome for the next 150 years. After a series of defeates early in the Third century BC, the Gauls remained quiet for 50 years. Then in 232 the Romans began settling on captured Gallic lands. This roused the barbarians to prepare another invasion. This time, the Cisalpine Gauls were joined by their kinsmen from across the Alps, the fierce Gaesatae under their Kings Aneroestes and Concolitanus. In 225 BC a force of 70,000 Gauls descended on Etruria and overran the country looting and pillaging. When they reached Clusium, a city only three days' journey from Rome, a Roman army led by a praetor appeared on their heels forcing them to turn back and confront it. The two armies camped for the night in close proximity.</p><p>The Gauls kept their campfires burning, but withdrew their infantry, leaving only their cavalry behind. The horsemen had orders that when the enemy approached, they were to retire toward Faesulae and their infantry, which lay in ambush. At daybreak, the Romans, seeing the cavalry alone and thinking the Gauls had taken to flight, followed the cavalry with all speed. On their approach the Gauls sprang from ambush and attacked them. A stubborn conflict took place, but finally the numbers and courage of the Gauls prevailed. The surviving Romans retreated to a hill, while the Gauls set up a loose blockade. These fugitives would all have been lost, but the consul Aemilius Paullus arrived with a relief army that night. The Gallic kings chose to retreat with their booty rather than fight another battle. They broke camp before daybreak and retreated along the seacoast through Etruria</p>

  <p>After their victory at Clusium, over 60,000 Gauls under Kings Aneorestes and Concolitanus retreated northwards, pursued by Aemilius Papus with about 30,000 troops. It looked like the Gauls would escape with their booty. Then fortune smiled on Rome. The consul Atilius Regulus was returning from suppressing a rebellion in Sardinia with his army of 25,000 men. He landed at Pisae and was moving south along the same coastal road that the Gauls had chosen for their retreat. Upon learning from his scouts that a Gallic army was approaching, Regulus ordered his legions into fighting order while he advanced at full speed with his cavalry and light infantry to occupy a key hill before the enemy arrived. The Gauls at once sent their own cavalry, chariots, and some light-armed troops to dispute the possession of the hill. When Papus arrived from the south, he also sent his cavalry to the hill, and advanced with his legions. At first the battle was confined to the hill and both armies watched the fighting unfold. Regulus fell, but the Roman cavalry, after a stubborn struggle, gained the hill. Meanwhile, Aenorestes and Concolitanus formed two battle lines back-to-back as the Roman infantry converged on the Gauls from north and south. There was a dreadful din as the whole Gallic army shouted war cries and the Roman light infantry hurled javelins. The Gallic host rushed wildly on their enemy in a rage, but the Roman maniples held their ground. Finally, the Roman cavalry charged down the hill and the Gallic infantry were cut to pieces.</p>

  <p>Not content with the slaughter of the Gauls at Telamon, the Romans launched a series of punitive expeditions into Cisalpine Gaul over the next three years. In 222 a combined Roman army under the consuls Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio, was besieging the Gallic town of Acerrae. The Gallic King Britomartus responded by laying siege to Roman-allied Clastidium with an army of 10,000 men. While Scipio pressed the siege of Acerrae with the legions, Marcellus set off with all the Roman cavalry (less than 4,000) and the pick of the light equipped velites to rescue Clastidium. Marcellus was a veteran of the First Punic War and already distinguished for his bravery and prowess.</p><p>Without halting day or night, Marcellus surprised the Gauls at Clastidium. Faced with a Roman force far sooner than expected, the barbarians were forced to lift the siege and march out to meet the oncoming Romans. Though not yet in good order, the Gauls immediately charged in their customary manner with great violence and dreadful threats. King Britomartus rode out in front of his troops, Marcellus led his cavalry forward, extending his wings into a thin line. When he was not far from then enemy, he turned to charge. Meanwhile Britomartus saw Marcellus, and rode far out in front of the rest to challenge him. Marcellus rushed upon the king and slew him with three quick blows. With their king dead the Gallic forces were cut down or put to flight in short order. Never before in Roman history had their cavalry inflected such a defeat against a larger force both dismounted and mounted. Marcellus was awarded the spolia optima for slaying an enemy king in single combat. Both Marcellus and Gnaeus Scipio would soon be facing Hannibal and the Carthaginians.</p>

  <p>Following the Punic Wars, Rome set out to consolidate the territories it had captured beyond the Alps. At the same time a major migration by the Cimbri, Teutons and Ambrones under the Kings Boiorix and Teutobod was moving south, reportedly with over 200,000 men (a great exaggeration, more likely the fighters numbered about 50,000). Two Roman armies were went to stop this migration with nearly 80,000 legionnaires. However, bitter differences between the Consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus and the Proconsul Quintus Servillius Caepio prevented the two Roman armies from cooperating, with devastating results.</p><p>The Roman forces were camped by the Rhone River, near Arausio (modern Orange). However, the armies did not camp together. Caepio pitched his tents closer to the enemy, and his dispositions are shown on the battlefield (Maximus and his army have made camp off map). The sight of two Roman armies made Boiorix cautious, and he entered into negotiations with Maximus. Caepio, motivated by hatred and envy of Maximus, foolishly launched an attack on the barbarians. Caepio's army was annihilated due to the hasty nature of this piecemeal assault. With a boost in confidence from this easy victory, the barbarians proceeded to advance, pin Maximus' army against the river, and destroy it also. In terms of human lives lost, Arausio was among the most lethal battles in world history, and Rome's worst defeat since Cannae. The terrible defeat had one beneficial result for Rome. It gave Gaius Marius the opportunity to come to the fore and radically reform the organization and recruitment of Rome's legions.</p>

  <p>The fircest slave revolt outbreak, before Spartacus, was known as the Second Sicilian Slave War (104 - 100 BC). Publius Licinius Nerva, governor of Sicily, in accordance with a Senatorial order that no citizen of an allied state could be kept as a slave in a Roman province, set free a number of Sicilian slaves. However, he ceased the emancipations after raising expectations, creating major unrest. Athenion led a slave rebellion in the west, resulting in the Battle of Lilybaeum. Meanwhile, other slaves also revolted and elected Salvius as their king. In order to prevent internecine slave fighting, Athenion deferred to Salvius' authority and became his general. Their combined armies were said to number 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse. Salvius defeated the forces of Nerva and the rebellion spread throughout all of Sicily.</p><p>The Roman Senate dispatched the Praetor Lucius Lucullus to Sicily with 1,600 reinforcements and he incorporated the remnants of Nerva's army into his own. Salvius and Lucullus met near Scirthaea. During the battle, Athenion achieved miracles with the rebel cavalry until he was wounded and left for dead. The Romans then won the battle and massacred most of the slaves rather than take prisoners. For partisan political reasons, Lucullus did not exploit his victory to hunt down the last of the slave rebels, but left a simmering rebellion to his successor C. Servilius, who proved to be incompetent. Thus the rebellion continued until 100 BC.</p>

  <p>Following the disaster at Arausio in 105 BC, Rome elected Marius as Consul to deal with the emergency. He was granted a reprieve as the Teutones and Ambrones decided to invade Spain rather than Italy, and spent the years 104 - 103 reorganizing the Roman army. Then in 102 BC, the Germanic tribes once again moved toward Rome. They reportedly numbered over 110,000 men, but half that number is a more likely estimate. Marius crossed the Alps with an army of over 40,000 legionnaires and Ligurian auxiliaries and set up camp near the coastal route being followed by the Teutone and Ambrone tribes under their King Teutobodus. Marius allowed the two tribes to pass and then followed them until they came to Aquae Sextiae. He occupied the high ground in view of the enemy, after posting an ambush force under Marcellus. Hostilities began almost immediately. The tribes charged up the hill, but the terrain was n the Roman favor and they forced back the barbarians. At this time Marcellus' ambush force appeared, and charged into the enemy rear. The entire horde broke and fled. Tens of thousands of the barbarians were slain, and many captured, including Teutobodus. Hundreds of the Germanic women committed mass suicide rather than become slaves of Rome.</p>

Marius' well-trained veteran legions foiled the Cimbric cavalry charge and then joined Catulus' legions in the center that were taking the brunt of the Cimbri attack. Meanwhile, Marius' lieutenant Lucius Cornelius Sulla was winning his battle on the right wing. The legions of Marius and Catulus in the center ultimately forced the Cimbric infantry to fall back, and the retreat turned into a rout as they fled back to their camp. Thousands of Cimbri were taken prisoner while many more were slain, including Beorix. As a result, the tribes from the north ceased to pose a threat to Roman expansion. Disputes over the credit for this great victory sowed the seeds of the later Civil War between Marius and Sulla.</p>

"CnC-A 0215 - Mount Vesuvius" {
  10630
  <p>The greatest slave revolt against Rome was led by a gladiator named Spartacus. The was a Thracian slave, trained as a gladiator by his owner, Lentulus Batiatus, at a gladiator school near Capua. Spartacus escaped from the school with 78 fellow gladiators. After some successful skirmishes with local guards, his force set about raiding the countryside, freeing more slaves to join their ranks. Spartacus set up a base on the defensible slopes of Mount Vesuvius. Remembering the earlier Slave Wars in Sicily, the Senate in Rome took this outbreak seriously. They dispatched Praetors Claudius Glaber and Publius Varinius with 3,000 men to suppress the uprising. Glaber and Varinius blockaded Spartacus at his base on Mount Vesuvius, intending to starve out the slaves since their camp was only accessible by a narrow and difficult passage. The wily Spartacus did not intend to be starved into submission, so he devised a daring plan. He ordered ladders to be made from the vines that grew on Vesuvius. Spartacus and most of his followers quietly descended the vine ladders, undetected by the Romans. Soon, a picked force of the slaves rushed the Roman camp from the mountain. Once the Romans were fully occupied by this attack, Spartacus and his force struck unexpectedly. Attacked from both sides, the Roman camp fell in short order. This victory over regular Roman forces allowed Spartacus to expand his operations and recruit a massive slave army.</p>

"CnC-A 0216 - Mount Garganus" {
  10630
  <p>Spartacus was an able strategist, and he knew that his rag-tag army could not expect to defy Rome indefinitely. Spartacus planned to escape from Roman territory over the Alps, and headed north through Apulia. He divided his ever-growing army and placed his lieutenant, Crixus, a Gaul, in charge of a force of 30,000 German and Gallic slaves, while he maintained personal command of the remaining 40,000 fighters. Crixus was over-confident after their many victories and allowed Spartacus to march far ahead while he allowed his men to continue their raiding and plundering. The consul Lucius Gellius Publicola came upon them suddenly and forced a battle. Crixus hastily formed his available men into a line of battl, but Publicola's legionnaires cut them to pieces. Crixus was killed, along with two-thirds of his men. The survivors scattered and many probably re-joined Spartacus' main column.</p>

  <p>Following the defeat of his lieutenant Crixus, Spartacus continued north for the Alps, passing through Picenum. Two Roman armies moved against him. From the south, the consul Lucius Gellius Publicola pursued with his army, fresh from his victory at Mount Garganus. To the north, his fellow consul Glaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus moved to block Spartacus' path. The Roman plan was initially successful. Spartacus was cornered, and the two Roman armies advanced to within sight of each other. Unfortunately, the Roman commanders, disdainful of Spartacus' abilities, became too clever for their own good. They left an inviting gap between the two Roman armies, as if in error, to invite Spartacus to attack between both armies. Spartacus had other ideas. He split his army, leaving a small force to keep Lentulus busy, while he led the main attack against Gellius. Outnumbered, this Roman army was defeated. Spartacus then turned his troops against Lentulus. The second army was also smashed. The Roman leaders escaped capture, but large numbers of prisoners and much equipment fell into the hands of the slave army. Spartacus sacrificed 300 Roman captives to avenge Crixus, and then resumed his march to the Alps and freedom.</p>

"CnC-A 0218 - Mummius' Defeat" {
  10630
  <p>In the autumn of 72 BC, Marcus Licinius Crassus was chosen by the Senate to lead the war against Spartacus' slave army. Crassus, a leading politician, was also rumored to be the richest man in Rome. How all this would translate into military success was anybody's guess, but many noble volunteers flocked to join his army of six legions. Meanwhile, the victorious slave army was marching southward again. Spartacus proposed a negotiated settlement, but Crassus refused to consider it. Next, Crassus assigned two of the legions to his deputy, Mummius, and gave him the task of harassing the flank of the slave army. Mummius was to slow down the slave army while the main force under Crassus waited on the border of Picenum, expecting Spartacus would come back that way. Unfortunately, Mummius wanted to maximize his own glory and foolishly attacked, even though outnumbered. His detachment was routed, and many of his legionnaires survived only by abandoning their arms and fleeing. Crassus subjected the remnants of Mummius' legions to decimate, a harsh punishment not used in many years. One man in each squad of ten was chosen by lot and executed before the whole army. The legionnaires learned to fear Crassus more than they feared Spartacus.</p>

  <p>Spartacus retreated through Lucania into Bruttium and toward the sea. He encamped at Rhegium where he attempted to gain passage to Sicily with the help of some Cilician pirate ships. Sparctacus judged he could open a new front against Rome by starting another slave rebellion in Sicily. Unfortunately, the trecherous pirates deceived Spartacus. After coming to terms with him and receiving payment, they simply sailed away. When Crassus came upon Spartacus at Rhegium, he decided to exploit the engineering skills of his legions. The Roman army built a wall and ditch across the isthmus, some 30 kilometers in length. Spartacus was walled in, but he did not attempt to break out until his provisions began to fail. After two strenuous efforts to break free, his main force still remained trapped. Waiting and watching for a weak spot, the opportunity came one snowy night. The Slave army crossed the ditch and breached the wall to gain its freedom, but casualties were still very heavy, and only about a third of Spartacus's men were able to escape. Crassus hurried after them in pursuit.</p>

  <p>After Spartacus escaped the Roman siege in Bruttium, the Gallic section of his slave army moved separately under the command of Cannicus and Castus. Marcus Licinius Crassus was now in a race, not only with the enemy, but also with his rival, Gnaeus Pompey. The Senate had recalled Pompey and his army from Spain to reinforce Crassus. However, Crassus felt he had nearly won this war, and now wanted to complete it before Pompey could arrive and steal any of his glory. Desperate to annihilate the slaves before Pompey's arrival, Crassus saw a possible move. He dispatched Quintus Marcius Rufus to make a flank march and gain the rear of the Gallic detachment of the slave army. Two Gallic women spotted Marcius' flanking force and raised the alarm. Marcius' smaller command was in great danger until Crassus, after a forced march, engaged the Gauls in battle from the front. The two Roman forces would have overwhelmed the Gauls, had not Spartacus come to their rescue with the rest of the slave army, allowing them to escape. Crassus scored an incomplete victory, and Spartacus continued his retreat.</p>

  <p>Spartacus found his army trapped between the armies of Marcus Licinius Crassus to his front and Gnaeus Pompey, approaching from the rear. Crassus had started construction of his camp when a skirmish between the two armies escalated into a full battle. Crassus's troops formed more quickly, and launched an effective attack before Spartacus could deploy all of his troops. Spartacus, seeing that his army was in jeopardy, killed his warhorse in front of the troops he had formed, a clear sign of defiance that could only mean one thing - he would fight to the death. As it became clear that his army was being defeated, Spartacus attempted to cut his way through the Roman troops to kill Crassus in one last desperate attempt to save the day. Spartacus was cut down by an arrow. in the end, thousands of men lay dead near the River Silarus, with Spartacus simply one body amongst many. Over 6,000 slave soldiers were captured, and Crassus had them all crucified along the Appian Way, from Capua to Rome. Crassus had defeated Spartacus, but Pompey managed to mop up a few thousand slave fugitives, and took credit for ending the rebellion.</p>

"CnC-A 0222 - River Sabis" {
  10630
  <p>Gaius Julius Caesar formed a political alliance with Gnaeus Pompey and Licinius Crassus that became known as the "First Triumvirate." Caesar obtained the governorship of Gaul as a proconsul, and immediately set about expanding his province from the Mediterranean coast inland. In 58 BC, after many Belgic tribes had surrendered to Caesar, he marched north against the Nervii, the most powerful of these tribes. Joined by other lesser tribes, including the Atrebates and Viromandui, the Nervii horde massed on the north side of the river Sabis. Poor scouting by the Romans only detected some cavalry acting as a decoy, while the Nervii king Boduognatus concealed his main body in the woods, not far from the main camp. Only when the Romans had dispersed from their tactical formation and started to build their camp did the Belgic tribesmen charge from the woods. The surprise was complete. Caesar was caught off guard, but in true form, he set about immediately to rally his troops. The Romans quickly reformed - a testimony to his personal magnetism and to their training. This hurriedly assembled line held until the two legions that were marching with the baggage could come forward. These reinforcements, along with the famous Tenth Legion's bold actions, and the vigor of his deputy Labienus, enabled the Romans to annihilate the Nervii army.</p>

  <p>Following two years of successful campaigning, Caesar believed he had pacified southern and western Gaul and left for Illyria. Sensing an opportunity, the Veneti and neighboring tribes on the Atlantic coast rebelled. These coastal tribes had their own navy, so when Caesar returned, he had a Roman fleet built to subdue them. The Roman fleet won a decisive victory at Morbihan Bay. Meanwhile, to defeat the rebellion on land, Caesar detailed Publius Crassus (son of the great Marcus Licinius Crassus) to Aquitania to subdue the Sotiates, so that they could not aid the Veneti. Adiatuanos, the King of the Sotiates, levied a large army, particularly strong in cavalry. When Crassus was marching through their territory, he was attacked while still in column of march. Adiatuanos first attacked with his cavalry. When they were repulsed, his concealed foot soldiers fell on the Roman column. Only after a fierce struggle did the Sotiates break and flee back to the town of Sotium. Crassus besieged the town and Adiatuanos and the inhabitants soon capitulated.</p>

  <p>With most of Gaul under his control, Caesar saw a need to pacify the nearby British coast, lest this island serve as a sanctuary and base for anti-Roman Gauls. Caesar sailed to Britain late in the campaign season with only two legions. The intended landing sight, above the cliffs of Dover, was lined with warriors, which forced Caesar to sail further north. The British cavalry and chariots kept pace with the fleet, however, and when the ships landed between Walmer and Deal, the Britons were waiting. The heavily laden Roman troops could only land by jumping into the sea and wading ashore.</p><p>Wild melees ensued all along the beach and only after a number of cohorts gained dry land, following the lead of the Tenth Legion, did they form up and charge. This attack finally drove the Britons from the beach. Without cavalry, because his cavalry transports never arrived, Caesar was not able to turn the retreat into a rout.</p><p>News spread of the Roman victory and tribal chiefs appeared before Caesar to offer submission. Unfortunately, a violent storm shatterred the unprotected Roman fleet, and Caesar was forced to return to Gaul before he could exploit the fruits of this first invasion.</p>

This time the landing (near Sandwich) was unopposed.</p><p>As Caesar moved inland, he encountered a delaying force of Briton charioteers and cavalry in front of the River Stour. The Romans found it difficult to come to grips with the elusive Britons at first, but in time they drove them back. The Roman cavalry played a key role in bringing the British chariots to battle.</p><p>Post Battle: After retreating across the Stour, the tribal forces joined the rest of the Britons at an oppidum near Bigbury. Caesar promptly crossed the Stour, stormed, and captured, this fortified position.</p>

  <p>When Caesar resumed his march inland, the Britons united under their newly appointed leader, Cassivellaunus. He ordered his troops to avoid pitched battles with the legions. Instead, they were to just harry the flanks of the legions and to attrit the Roman cavalry by drawing them into skirmishes, only to retire after a brief fight. Caesar was impressed with the mobility and open order fighting capability of the tribesman. He countered by increasing the size of his foraging parties and emphasizing the need for the legionnaires to support the cavalry.</p><p>The next Roman foraging party was almost 20,000 strong, with three legions and all the cavalry. Caesar assigned the legate Gaius Trebonius to lead this detachment. Aware of the large amount of Roman infantry in the column, Cassivellaunus still broke his own rules and attacked - confident that his forces could strike and retire before the legions could close to battle. Trebonius ordered a counter attack and the Roman cavalry, closely supported by the legions, broke out of the attempted encirclement. The Roman cavalry then charged home and routed the Britons. The defeat broke the British alliance of tribes and gave Caesar temporary control of this part of the island.</p>

"CnC-A 0227 - Teutoburger Wald - Part I, Ambush" {
  10630
  <p>Julius Caesar had established Rome's northeast boundary as the Rhine River a half century earlier. But the Emperor Caesar Augustus decided to extend imperial control all the way to the Elbe. A task that seemed easy on a map in Rome proved far more difficult to the commanders in the field. Yet, despite difficulties, Rome's conrol was extended to the Elbe. The warlike Germanic tribesmen, temporarily subdued, lacked only an inspirational leader to spark an uprising. Arminius was the man.</p><p>As a young German noble of the Cherusci tribe, Arminius had been placed under Roman tutelage, a common practice. He served in the Roman amy as a commander of auxiliaries. This only served to fuel his hate, but he bided his time and learned their tactical methods. His opportunity to strike arose when Publius Quintilius Varus was leading three legions on a march through Germany. Arminius knew it would be difficult for the Germans to defeat a well-led Roman force in the open, so he devised a plan to lure Varus' legions toward Kalkriese Hill, where he would launch his ambush. The Germans constructed a camouflaged sod wall to improve the already ideal ambush site. The seemingly loyal Arminius accompanied Varus' march column until one night he and his German auxiliaries disappeared. A good tactician would have sensed trouble, but Varus arrogantly elected to march on without adequate reconnaissance. At dawn the next day, as the Romans undertook to march through the area on a narrow track between woods and swamp, the Germans attacked from the woods. In a scene eerily reminiscent of Lake Trasimenus, the Romans were pinned where they could not properly deploy. Roman counterattacks proved ineffectual and all the Roman infantry could do was endure the constant assaults. As night fell, Varus' survivors constructed a fortified camp.</p>

  <p>Throughout the first day of battle, German attacks had harassed the disjointed Roman column as they struggled along. That night Varus' men constructed a fortified camp knowing that Arminius would not dare assault a well-manned prepared position. The Romans were still in dire straits. Lacking provisions, they had but two choices - remain and starve, or face the prospect of death fighting their way out. Varus chose to fight.</p><p>On the second day, even though the Germans no longer had the element of surprise, the constricted terrain still put the Romans at a severe disadvantage. By day's end, 13,000 Romans and auxiliaries lay dead in the Teutoburger wilderness when the column broke out of the dense forest. Once again the Roman soldiers built their camp. The 7000 or so survivors must have known that it would be their last. Varus, it is written, knew the end was near and took his life. Numonius Vala rallied the remnants of the cavalry and attempted a breakout the next morning. The Germans were waiting, and all were slaughtered. The Roman foot soldiers that remained fought on, and a handful of reduced cohorts managed to slip through the German lines. Over 15,000 Romans had fallen, and the news of the disaster profoundly affected Caesar Augustus, who cried for days on end, "Varus, where are my legions?" A series of expeditions would be launched to recover the three lost legionary eagles. The three destroyed legions, the 17th, 18th, and 19th, were never rebuilt, and remained forever disgraced.</p>

  <p>Following the catastrophe at the Teutoburger Wald, Augustus dispatched a series of punitive expeditions into Germany. In 14 AD, Tiberius became emperor and assigned his adopted son Germanicus Julius Caesar to the German province. In AD 16, Arminius decided the time had come to destroy another Roman army.</p><p>He deployed his Germanic army to ambush Germanicus at a point in a plain between a forest and a deep, broad stream. His infantry waited behind an old boundary rampart while he deployed his cavalry in the woods, waiting to charge out onto the Roman rear. Germanicus was a far better tactician than Varus. He scouted well and did not fall for the trap, sending auxiliary infantry into the forest to occupy the German cavalry while his legions attacked the ramparts.</p><p>The first Roman attempt at the ramparts was repulsed, so Germanicus orderd forward his engines and light troops to soften up the Germanic position. The second attack broke through the rampart and the Germans behind the ramparts fled. The battle then shifted to the woods where the fighting went on until dusk. Arminius withdrew in the darkness and the Roman cavalry pursuit was indecisive. Germanicus had won a tactical victory with little strategic impact. Arminius had survived with a depleted but intact army to continue the fight. In the following year, the Emperor Tiberius decided to abandon Germany and fix the limit of the Roman Empire at the Rhine. Roman expansion was at an end, and the Germanic tribes remained free, with dramatic implications for the future of Europe.</p>

  10630
  <p>The Roman conquest of Britain had been underway for four years when a new Roman commander, Publius Ostorius Scapula, was assigned to the province in 47 AD. He faced an on-going insurgency, led by Caratacus, chieftain of the Cautuvellauni tribe. In 51 AD, Caratacus took up a good defensive position with his tribesmen on high ground with the Severn River to his front. Most of the hills were steep, and he constructed rough stone ramparts where the hill slope was not as great, making it difficult for the Romans to close with his forces. At first, Scapula did not want to attack the strong defensive position. Only the eagerness of his men - and the prospect to finally bring Caratacus to battle after chasing him for so long - changed his mind. Scapula ordered a frontal attack.</p><p>The Romans crossed the stream with little difficulty, but suffered heavy casualties from the rain of enemy missiles. Once across, the legionaries swarmed over the stone ramparts and up the steep hills. At close quarters, the Romans' superior weapons and tactics took a heavy toll on the tribesmen, and their resistance collapsed. Caratacus escaped, but the battle of Cefn Carnedd was the final battle in his resistance to Roman rule.</p>

"CnC-A 0308 - Colline Gate" {
  10630
  <p>Lucius Cornelius Sulla became the leader of the "optimates" faction in the civil war with the "populares" led by Gaius Marius. Sulla seized Rome in 88 BC and reorganized the government to his liking. However, when Sulla marched east to campaign against Mithridates of Pontus, Marius regained control of the capitol. Many of Sulla's supporters were hunted down and killed. Although Marius died soon after, his son and other "populares" leaders maintained control of Rome. Meanwhile, Sulla defeated Mithridates and outmanruvered a Marian army in Pontus, returning to Italy in 82 BC to restore his position and punish the Marians. Sulla quickly defeated the Marian forces in Etruria and then marched to take control of Rome in November</p><p>The remnants of the Marian forces, after their losses in Etruria, joined up with the Samnite army under Pontius Telesinus. The combined army advanced on Rome, and encamped near the Colline Gate on the northwest wall of Rome. Sulla took up a position just outside the gate and deployed. The ensuing battle was a desperate struggle, with both sides believing they were fighting to save Rome. Sulla's legions were pushed hard on his left flank, and his men literally fought with their backs against the city walls. However, Crassus' forces, fighting on Sulla's right, managed to turn the opposition's flank and drive them back. Riding his white horse, Sulla arrived on the left and rallied the flank. Still, it was not until the early hours of the next morning that the Samnites and the Marian forces were broken. In the aftermath, Sulla's enemies in Rome were rooted out and eliminated, leaving him with absolute power as dictator.</p>

  <p>Quintus Sertorius was a Roman noble who gained a reputation as a skillful military commander in the wars with the Cimbri and Teutones, and then in the Social War. Sertorius supported Marius "populares" and opposed Sullas' "optimates" during the first Roman civil war, 88 - 81 BC. After being driven from Italy by Sulla and then expelled from Spain by Sulla's lieutenants, Sertorius conducted a successful campaign in Mauritania, creating a well-trained army in the process. At this time, Lusitanian emissaries approached Sertorius to beg him to lead them in a rebellion against Sulla's harsh rule in Spain. After winning a naval battle against Aurelius Cotta, Sertorius landed in southern Spain with a small force of Roman infantry and Moorish cavalry that was quickly joined by Lusitanian tribal levies of horse and foot.</p><p>The Sullan governor of Hither Spain, Lucius Fufidius, gathered his forces and moved to cut Sertorius off at the Baetis River. Although Fufifius commanded a larger army that also included Roman legionnaires, Sertorius outmaneuvered him with his more mobile irregular force. Sertorius won a great victory. Fufidius retired and thousands more flocked to join Sertorius after his stunning victory.</p>

"CnC-A 0310 - Lauron" {
  10630
  <p>Quintus Sertorius defeated a series of Roman generals and nearly all of Spain joined his rebellion. He solidified his support through a just administration of the provinces and gained the loyalty of most of the Spanish tribes. Sertorius came to be known as the "second Hannibal" due to his military genius and the fact that he also had lost one eye. Marcus Perpenna arrived from Italy to reinforce Sertorius with a small army and a large number of outlawed "populares" nobles. Sertorius then established a government in exile, creating a "senate" of 300 of the outlawed Roman nobles. Rome was forced to send her best general, the arrogant and ambitious Gnaeus Pompey, to Spain to suppress the uprising.</p><p>Sertorius laid siege to the Roman allied city of Lauron and Pompey marched to relieve it. A nearby hill appeared to be important and both armies raced to capture the key position. Although Sertorius' forces succeeded, Pompey thought that he had trapped the enemy between the city and his army. Pompey, disdainful of Sertorius and his army, sent a message to the citizens of Lauron, for them to come to the city walls and watch the destruction of Sertorius. Pompey, however, was so intent on his move to trap Sertorius that he failed to observe a hidden force of 6000 Sertorian soldiers. These troops burst from cover and attacked the rear of Pompey's army. At the same time, Sertorius' cavalry charged home. Pompey was forced to retire in disorder, and could only watch as Lauron was captured and burned to the ground.</p>

  <p>In the campaigns fought in Spain following the battle of Lauron, Quintus Sertorius proved to be a superior general to Gnaeus pompey. However, Pompey recognized that even if he couldn't defeat Sertorius, he could defeat his lieutenants.</p><p>Pompey had begun another campaign against the rebel towns. Sertorius detailed two of his subordinate Roman exiles, Gaius Herennius and Marcus Perpenna, to march to Valentia, and keep Pompey occupied while he dealt with some tribes that had defected. Pompey advanced against the combined forces and forced a battle. Unfortunately for Sertorius, Herennius and Perpenna could not agree on the overall command and fought as separate forces. Pompey attacked Herennius' legions first while Perpenna (nursing both pride and ambition) did nothing to assist. However, before Pompey could turn on the other wing, Perpenna withdrew with his forces. Over 10,000 rebels were slain. Pompey had his first major victory in Spain.</p>

  <p>Gnaeus Pompey had regained his confidence after his victory at Valentia, and now moved quickly to engage Quintus Sertorius before Quintus Caecilius Metellus could arrive with his reinforcing army and share in the honor of victory. Sertorius was equally eager to fight before Metellus' arrival would tip the odds in Pompey's favor. As the battle commenced, Sertorius at first deployed opposite Afranius, holding him in check until he received word that his left (under the vain, but mediocre Perpenna) was giving way before Pompey's onslaught. Sertorius then drove Afranius back and wheeled to the assistance of his left wing. Pompey's forces, advancing in apparent victory, were struck in the flank and swept off the field in disorder. Pompey only managed to escape by abandoning his horse and sneaking away on foot. During the night, his badly beaten army was bolstered by Metellus' arrival. The opposing armies deployed again for battle the next day, but Sertorius, seeing numbers were now against him, withdrew his weakened but victorious army to his mountain strongholds to fight another day.</p><p>Sertorius remained undefeated. He negotiated alliances with the Cilician pirates, Mithridates VI of Pontus, and Spartacus in Italy, creating a serious crisis for Rome. However, all of Sertorius' successes were undone by the petty jealousy of Perpenna and a small group of Roman exiles, who assassinated the great general at a banquet. Once Sertorius had been killed in 72 BC, Pompey would next race back to Italy to join with Crassus in the final campaign against Spartacus.</p>

  10630
  <p>Gaius Julius Caesar, an ambitious Roman noble, had entered into a political alliance with Gnaeus Pompey and Marcus Licinius Crassus, which became known as the "First Triumvirate." Caesar used these connections to obtain an appointment as proconsul for Gaul. As Caesar arrived to govern his province, the Helvetii were migrating from what is now Switzerland into Gaul to find new lands.</p><p>Caesar surprised and defeated one detachment of the Helvetii. He then doggedly followed but avoided conflict with the main body, as he was badly outnumbered by the barbarians and needed to find an advantageous position for a decisive battle. After a fortnight, Roman supplies were running short and Caesar fell back toward Bibracte to replenish. The Helvetii followed and formed for battle against the Romans.</p><p>Caesar withdrew and formed his six legions on a nearby range of hills - his four veteran legions in front, and his two newly raised legions in the rear. The Helvetii charged forward and were met by a shower of pila. The Romans then counter charged downhill with swords drawn. The disorganized barbarians started to fall back when allied Boii and Tulingi tribesmen marched forward and gave the retiring Helvetii the heart to continue. Caesar again led his legions forward against the combined tribes, and they fled in disorder back to their camp. During the night Caesar attacked the enemy camp and completed the rout. The next day, envoys from the tribes offered to surrender and Caesar ordered them to return to their own lands, knowing that if their former country were left unpopulated hostile Germanic tribes would fill the vacuum.</p>

  <p>Ariovistus was the chief of the Germanic Suebi tribe. He led his tribesmen across the Rhine into Gaul at the invitation of some warring Gallic tribes. Once in Gaul, Ariovistus called on his German allies, the Harudes, Marcomanni, Triboci, Vangiones, Nemetes, and Sedusii to join his army. More Germans poured across the Rhine every day. Caesar, aware of the mounting threat to the Roman province, advanced at top speed to the plain of Alsace within a few miles of Ariovistus' army.</p><p>At first, Ariovistus refused to fight, for diviners had foreseen that he was not destined to win before the new moon. Caesar, forced the issue by deploying his legions near the enemy camp, a challenge that the Germans could not ignore. Ariovistus was compelled to come out and line up for battle. The German left wing looked weaker and it was here that Caesar launched his main attack with his favorite X Legion leading his right wing. The Germans also favored their right and began to press back the Roman left. Then Publius Crassus (son of the Crassus of the First Triumvirate) charged forward with the cavalry to relieve the harassed Roman wing. This caused the pendulum to swing in favor of the Roman forces and soon the Germanic horde was in flight back across the Rhine.</p>

"CnC-A 0315 - Gergovia" {

  <p>Julius Caesar had conquered Gaul in just six years of campaigning (58 - 53 BC). However, in 52 BC most of the tribes of Gaul rose in a general revolt. Vercingetorix, a chieftain of the Averni, became overall commander of the rebel forces. Vercingetorix adopted an effective strategy of defending fortified towns in conjunction with scorched earth tactics to deny the Romans supplies. In response, Caesar assaulted and captured Avaricum. Next he marched against the Gallic army at Gergovia, Vercingetorix' hometown. Gergovia was situated on a particular steep, high mountain, making it a difficult position to attack. Caesar wanted to bring Vercingetorix into an open battle and stop the Gallic raids, so he set up c large camp for his six legions and built a small force to make a feint away from the town, drawing off many of Vercingetorix' troops, Caesar ordered his legions and allied troops to climb the hill and attack the enemy camps in front of the city. The Romans overcame the stone wall at the base of the hill and moved forward to capture the enemy camps. The Gallic reinforcements hurried to the scene and drove the Roman troops back in fierce fighting. The barbarian advance was only checked by the 10th Legion that was held in reserve. The Romans reported the loss of 46 centurions and 700 troops of all nationalities killed, and another 6,000 wounded. Gergovia was the only major battle that Caesar lost during his conquest of Gaul. The following day, Caesar attempted to offer battle again but could not induce Vercingetorix to descent from his hilltop position. Having failed to achieve his objective, Caesar withdrew.</p>

  <p>After driving Gnaeus Pompey from Italy, Julius Caesar moved against Pompey's forces in Spain. Caesar had sent Gaius Fabius ahead to secure the passes over the Pyrenees and at the Sicoris River. Fabius succeeded, and his opponent, Pompey's lieutenant Afranius, was forced to retire southward.</p><p>Caesar followed Afranius and camped about a half mile from his enemy and the town of Ilerda. Between the enemy camp and town there was a hillock, which appeared to Caesar as the best strategic position in the area. However, Afranius saw what Caesar intended and managed to gain the hill first, leaving Caesar's army in an awkward position. To relieve this situation, Caesar led his legion forward, but after some initial success they pressed their attack too far. The enemy effectively showered them with missiles from higher ground. Caesar's veterans were in a difficult position. They were taking unnecessary losses where they stood, but would take as many losses withdrawing. Caesar ordered forward his cavalry, which relived the pressure and gave his legions the opportunity to withdraw. The battle ended in a stalemate as both sides pulled back.</p><p>A three-month campaign followed, in which Caesar masterfully outmaneuvered Afranius, forcing the Pompeian army of seven veteran legions in Spain to surrender without fighting another major battle.</p>

"CnC-A 0317 - Utica I, Delaying Action" {
  10630
  <p>The First Triumvirate of Crassus, Pompey and Julius Caesar collapsed soon after Crassus was defeated and killed by the Parthians at Carrhae in 53 BC. With Crassus gone, the rivalry between Pompey and Caesar steadily grew until civil war erupted in 49 BC. After "crossing the Rubicon" with his troops, and violating Roman law, Caesar drove Pompey out of Italy in a lightning campaign. He then marched on Spain to confront "an army without a leader" - the Pompeian army there. Meanwhile, Caesar sent his general, Gaius Curio, with an army consisting mostly of newly raised legions to attack the Pompeian forces under Attius Varus in Africa. Varus was in camp below the walls of Utica. Curio marched to engage him there. While Curio was fortifying his camp, news arrived that a large force of horse and foot was approaching. This army had been sent by King Juba's general Saburra. Curio immediately sent his cavalry to delay the approaching enemy. Juba's Numidian forces were taken by surprise, as they were not expecting an attack. The Numidian cavalry was quickly put to flight and many infantry were killed before they too routed. What started as a mere delaying action escalated into a victory that surprised even Curio.</p>

When a relief army sent by King Juba of Numidia arrived to reinforce Varus, Curio had launched a delaying attack with his cavalry. The Numidians were routed and fled.</p><p>On the day after Curio's victory over the Numidians, both Curio and Varus marched out of camp and deployed for battle. There was a valley between the two armies and both sides waited to see who would make the first move.</p><p>Suddenly Varus' cavalry, along with some light troops, moved into and down the valley. This was perhaps a show of bravery, but Curio advanced his cavalry to end the show and Varus' cavalry was sent reeling. Curio then led the infantry forward and Varus' lights were cut down. All this was more than enough for Varus' troops, who turned and ran back to camp. Many were killed in the stampede.</p>

  <p>King Juba of Numidia continued to support the Pompeians even after Varus' defeat at Utica. Curio led his Caesarian army after Varus, catching up with him at the Bagradas River. Curio attacked and routed the demoralized Pompeian army, and Varus was wounded. Curio learned that Juba had sent another Numidian force as reinforcements and sent his cavalry on a night raid against the enemy's camp along the Bagradas River that accomplished little except to alert the Numidians to the Romans' presence.</p><p>Thinking the Numidian force was none too large, since Juba was not present, Curio decided to attack this force as well. Juba had been detained by a border dispute and Saburra was in command. Saburra, stung by his loss earlier at Utica, was not going to be caught unawares again. He placed his entire force under arms. At the same time his force was increased to army size by the arrival of Spanish and Gallic cavalry sent by Juba. Unknown to Curio, Saburra now commanded the bulk of an entire Numidian army. Foolishly, Curio launched an attack on this much larger Numidian force. Curio's main weakness was his lack of cavarly - the same weakness that had resulted in disaster to another Roman army in the same area much earlier (the Roman army of Regulus, largely destroyed by the Carthaginians in 253 BC). Though Curio's infantry fought well, their advance simple made it easier for the Numidian cavalry to surround the Romans. In desperation, Curio ordered his men to move toward a small hill but Saburra's forces got to the hill first. It was a slaughter, and Curio committed suicide rather than surrender. Africa would remain a Pompeian stronghold.</p>

"CnC-A 0320 - Brindisi Raid" {

  <p>While Julius Caesar was campaigning in Spain, Gnaeus Pompey was building a new army in Greece. After returning to Italy, Caesar made a risky January crossing of the Adriatic with a portion of his army, resolving to defeat his rival and end the civil war. The combined effects of bad weather and superior Pompeian naval forces prevented the remainder of Caesar's army, under Marc Antony, from making the crossing.</p><p>Pompey knew at this time his larger army was no match against Caesar's veterans, and Caesar would not hesitate to attack once he had his entire army concentrated. Pompey needed time to train up his troops. He formulated a daring plan to delay the remainder of Caesar's army in Italy from crossing. In February, Pompey dispatched his admiral, Libo, on a raid across the Adriatic. Libo commanded a large force of marines and fifty warships. His target was the seaport town of Brindisi and the ships gathered there. His mission - to destroy the Roman transport fleet. Libo landed his marines outside of Brindisi. Utilizing surprise, they overpowered the city guards and sank and burned several ships. However, Antony's troops, who were still waiting in the embarkation camps to cross the Adriatic, quickly formed and advanced toward Brindisi. Libo's marines were defeated by Antony's legions before they could destroy enough shipping to truly delay Antony's army from crossing. In the final analysis, Pompey's bold plan was a total failure. He had sacrificed many of his best-trained troops in the raid, but Antony was still able to cross the Adriatic and join Caesar for the battle at Dyrrhachium and the epic victory an Pharsalus.</p>

"CnC-A 0321 - Dyrrhachium" {
  10630
  <p>Julius Caesar crossed the Adriatic with seven depleted legions in order to confront Gnaeus Pompey's main army and bring the civil war to an end. Antony, with the remaining five legions, was delayed. Caesar followed Pompey to Asparagium and boldly offered battle but Pompey refused, in spite of numerical superiority, because his troops were much inferior in training to Caesar's veterans. meanwhile, Antony, blown far off course, had crossed the Adriatic and landed in Pompey's rear. Pompey, presented with the opportunity to destroy his opponents in detail, was obsessed instead about being trapped between them. Caesar moved quickly to join Antony and simultaneously threaten Dyrrhachium, Pompey's logistical base. Pompey marched to defend it, but Caesar joined Antony and occupied Dyrrhachium first. Caesar audaciously began blockading Pompey's  larger army against the sea by constructing a line of forts. Pompey retaliated with his own line of counter-fortifications.</p><p>Pompey's larger army began running short of supplies and (more importantly) water. He was left with no choice but to attack or surrender. He finally decided to break Caesar's line at the southern end of the fortifications, where Caesar's ramparts were not quite complete. Pompey's plan was excellent, as he landed a contingent of marines and light troops from the sea and at the same time stormed across the river with several of his best legions toward Caesar's weak point in his line. The defenders held for some time against this combined force, but finally they were pushed back. Antony's arrival stopped the advance, but Pompey's troops threw back Caesar's vastly outnumbered veterans as they counterattaked to retake their lines. Pompey built a new camp near the shore that secured access for his large cavalry arm to the grazing lands to the south. Caesar, desperately short of supplies himself, was forced to withdraw. His army moved into Thessaly, pillaging as they went, and regaining strength. Pompey warily pursued his rival.</p><p>Caesar consoled his troops afterward, telling them it was not lack of fighting prowess, but rather fate and circumstance that defeated them. His army's morale remained high, and they were most eager to avenge their defeat. Pompey's troops and the host of Senators accompanying the army began to see themselves as more than a match for Caesar and his veterans. It was this fatal overconfidence that compelled them to advance and do battle later at Pharsalus.</p>

"CnC-A 0322 - Pharsalus" {
  10630
  <p>After Dyrrhachium, Julius Caesar pulled back to regroup his army. Gnaeus Pompey failed to follow up his victory and pursued slowly. After a winter of maneuvering through Thessaly, Pompey encamped at the foot of the mountains near Pharsalus and was persuaded by the senators in his camp to settle the issue with Caesar once and for all. Pompey had a numerically superior but inexperienced force. Caesar's army was much smaller, but still composed of crack, veteran legions. Pompey's plan took into account his strength in cavalry and called out for it to out-flank Caesar's right. Caesar saw what Pompey planned and formed a line of legionary veterans in reserve to counter any out-flanking maneuver.</p><p>As the fighting began, Pompey's cavalry charge rolled over Caesar's horse. However, when confronted by Caesar's reserve, this mounted force was thrown back in turn by legionaries using their pila as spears. The Caesarian legionaries who routed the Pompeian cavalry now turned their attention to the exposed left flank of the Pompeian infantry line, pushing back some of Pompey's better legions stationed there. Caesar's legions in the center and on the left now began moving forward. Pompey's foot units were ordered to hold their ground. Normal battlefield tactics would find both sides advancing to the attack but Pompey's troops did not advance, hoping Caesar's infantry would tire themselves out in a long charge. Instead, Caesar's more experienced legions just halted within a few yards of Pompey's line, reforming and then make a headlong attack. With his cavalry defeated, his left flank turned and the center and right hard pressed, Pompey fled back to camp, leaving his army to disintegrate. Most of the survivors surrendered to Caesar the next day.</p><p>Pompey fled to Egypt, where he was assassinated by Ptolemy XIII. Caesar was now clearly ascendant, but mopping up the remaining Pompeians would still require much hard fighting in the east, Africa, and Spain.</p>

"CnC-A 0323 - Zela" {
  10630
  <p>Following his decisive victory at Pharsalus, Julius Caesar pursued Gnaeus Pompey to Egypt. Pompey was assassinated, effectively ending the civil war in the Eastern Mediterraneann but Caesar became involved in factional fighting in Alexandria in support of Cleopatra. Meanwhile, Pharnaces, King of Pontus, began harassing the Romans in Anatolia, so Caesar sent Domitius Calvinus with a small army to hold him at bay. While Caesar was finishing up with his Egyptian campaign, Pharnaces thrashed Domitius at Nicopolis.</p><p>In response, Caesar hurried to Anatolia with his VI legion and took command of the remnants of Domitius' army. As Caesar was starting to build his camp near Pharnaces, he was amazed when the Pontic forces began forming for battle just in front of his camp. Thinking it was a mere show of force on Pharnaces' part, Caesar's men kept working on their camp. But the Pontic army began advancing on the Roman position. When it became apparent that the enemy actually intended to do battle, the Romans had little time to assemble. Then the Pontic scythed chariots charged forward, adding to the confusion in the Roman ranks. The chariots were eventually driven back by missile fire. As the main lines came into contact, the VI legion on the right pushed the Pontic forces back in hard fighting. Elsewhere along the line, victory came more slowly, but in the end almost all of Pharnaces' army was captured or killed.</p><p>The report of the battle Caesar sent back to Rome was famously brief: "Veni, vidi, vici" (I came, I saw, I conquered.)</p>

"CnC-A 0324 - Ruspina" {
  10630
  <p>Following his victory over Pharnaces at Zela, Julius Caesar returned to Rome where a crisis was brewing - the surviving veterans had grown very war-weary and were refusing orders to deploy overseas yet again. Caesar's personal appeal sparked a renewal of loyalty to their magnetic leader, and the crisis was averted. Opposition awaited in North Africa. Pompeian forces under Porcius Cato Minor and Metellus Scipio had fled to Africa and joined forces with Attius Varus and King Juba. Caesar directed his next campaign against these Pompeian and allied Numidian forces. Once Caesar had transported his entire army to Africa, he set off with a sizeable force on a foraging expedition. They had gone a few miles when a much larger enemy force of Numidian cavalry and light troops deployed for battle to his front. The Numidians were commanded by Titus Labienus, formerly Caesar's deputy in Gaul and his opponent at Dyrrhachium and Pharsalus.</p><p>The enemy formation and tactics were quite novel to Caesar. The Numidian cavalry was interspersed with light infantry and would rush forward to throw their javelins. When the Romans charged, the enemy would retire. Meanwhile, the exposed Roman flanks were pelted by other enemy units. As the battle progressed, because of their numbers, the Numidian cavalry had almost surrounded Caesar's troops. Caesar countered by forming his line back to back and gradually retired toward his camp. At this point in the battle, the Numidians grew stronger yet when Marcus Petreius arrived with elite cavalry and more Numidian infantry. True to his nature, Caesar encouraged his utterly exhausted troops to make one last effort to drive the enemy back. The Roman attack succeeded, allowing them to withdraw. Caesar had lost nearly a third of his detachment and gained a healthy respect for his adversaries.</p>

"CnC-A 0325 - Thapsus" {
  10630
  <p>Following his set-back at Ruspina, Julius Caesar spent some time regrouping before making a surprise night march of 16 miles and camping near the Pompeian-held coastal town of Thapsus. Caesar immediately placed Thapsus under siege. Though numerically superior, Metellus Scipio, the Pompeian commander in the area, originally had no intention of risking a direct battle with the formidable Caesar. However, Caesar had forced the issue with his threat to Thapsus. If Scipio allowed a key city to fall without a fight, then key allies woiuld defect to Caesar. Scipio reluctantly brought his 40,000 man army up to relieve the city.</p><p>Scipio occupied a defensive position and drew up his line wit elephants (provided by King Juba) on the wings. Caesar opposed the pachyderms with light archers and slingers, while taking personal command of his right wing. As the battle began, volleys of missiles sent the elephants reeling. At nearly the same time, Caesar's infantry, eager for battle, attacked without orders. Many of the elephants stampeded into the center of Caesar's line, where the 5th legion Alaudae (the Larks) was advancing. The 5th was a Gallic legion, recruited in Transalpine Gaul. The Larks bravely stood firm against the elephants, and later adopted the elephant as their legionary symbol. Caesar's horse countered a Numidian cavalry charge and forced them to flee. After the failed charge, the Pompeian line crumbled and the rout was on. Pompeian resistance in Africa had been crushed, but the civil war was not quite over. There remained one more Pompeian bastion - Spain.</p>

"CnC-A 0326 - Munda" {
  10630
  <p>Following Julius Caesar's victory at Thapsus, the remnants of the Pompeian army under Titus Labienus fled to Spain. Here, the garrison legions had revolted in favor of Gnaeus Pompey, the eldest son of Pompey the Great. Pompey gathered a large but largely inexperienced army of thirteen legions. Caesar traveled to Spain to put a final end to Pompeian resistance. He brought three of his crack veteran legions, the 5th, 6th and 10th, but most of his army was also composed of newer recruits. The initial campaign was marked by extreme brutality by both sides, but no decisive battles were fought until Caesar brought Gnaeus Pompey to bay near Munda.</p><p>Pompey deployed in a strong hill top position so Caesar was faced with an uphill battle. Rather than maneuver for advantage, Caesar uncharacteristically ordered a frontal assault on the strong enemy position. Caesar's cavalry and light troops attacked both enemy wings but gained no advantage. Some of the hardest fighting in Caesar's life unfolded as the two armies slogged it out. The Pompeians fought with true desperation, for many of those soldiers had been pardoned by Caesar, and then deserted back to Pompey. For them there would be no second chances. Finally, Caesar's 10th legion on the right managed to push the opposing forces back. Pompey, under the council of Labienus, ordered troops to move from his right to the threatened left flank. Caesar's cavalry on the left saw the move and made a mighty charge that pushed back the Pompeian right wing. The faltering of both wings eventually caused the raw legions in Pompey's center to bolt back toward the town. About 30,000 Pompeians died - most slaughtered in the rout. Gnaeus Pompey died with them, and also Titus Labienus, Caesar's trusted aide who became his bitter opponent. Caesar had won the battle, but later said "he had fought many times for victory, but at Munda he fought for his life."</p><p>With his victory at Munda, Caesar finally brought the civil war to an end. Caesar returned to Rome and became "Dictator for Life." Peace did not last long as Caesar only ruled until March 15, 44 BC when he was assassinated.</p>

"CnC-A 0408 - Tigranocerta" {
  10630
  <p>Mithridates VI of Pontus challenged Rome for control of Asia Minor and Greece while the Romans were distracted in the Italian War. Although Rome defeated Mithridates in the First and Second Mithridatic Wars, he was allowed to maintain his kingdom in Pontus. A Third Mithridatic War began in 73 BC, and Mithridates suffered a major defeat at Cabira the following year. Mithridates fled to the court of his son-in-law, King Tigranes the Great of Armenia, who refused a Roman demand to surrender him. The Roman Proconsul, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, invaded Armenia with two Roman legions, defeating a small cavalry force and investing the capital city of Tigranocerta. Meanwhile, Tigranes raised a large force of Armenians and allies in Taurus.</p><p>As Tigranes' army approached to lift the siege, Lucullus split his force, leaving enough strengh to maintain the siege and deploying the rest of his army along a deep river to block the advancing Armenians. Tigranes deployed opposite the Romans, confident of an easy victory, but argued with Mithridates about the plan of action. Lucullus led a column out of sight of the Armenian army, crossed at a bend in the river, and gained Tigranes' right flank. Seeing the opportunity, Lucullus personally led the Roman charge down the hill against a force composed of both light horse and cataphracts. Tigranes tried to adjust his battle line but it was too late. The cavalry was either destroyed or driven off and the Armenian baggage train captured. The city of Tigranocerta fell to the Romans, but Tigranes and Mithridates fled with the rest of the army and continued to resist.</p>

  <p>Along with Pompey and Julius Caesar, Marcus Licinius Crassus formed the secret "Triumvirate" which all but controlled Rome. Reputedly the richest man in Rome, Crassus lacked any great military achievement to compare with Caesar's conquest of Gaul and Pompey's many exploits. An ambitious man, Crassus saw the conquest of the Parthian Empire as his opportunity to match or surpass his colleagues in glory. Crassus arrived in Syria with seven legions and 4000 cavarly and marched directly through the desert towards the parthian heartland. Shortly after crossing the Euphrates, his army was surprised near Carrhae by the Parthian general Surena and a cavalry force made up of horse archers and cataphracts. Crassus formed his men into an open square, but Surena made no effort to close, content to harass the Romans with a hail of arrows.</p><p>Crassus and his officers believed they had only to hold out until the horse archers expended the small number of shafts they could carry with them. However, Surena had brought along a camel train with a huge re-supply of arrows. Crassus sent his son Publius forward with the Roman cavalry to pin down the horse archers but the Parthians fell back. Publius rashly pursued too far and Surena annihilated his force. Publius' head was carried back to the Romans upon a spear to taunt his father. This broke the spirit of Crassus and the Roman soldiers, throats cracking with thirst, were overwhelmed. Crassus withdrew with a mere 500 survivors westward when the Parthians retired for the night. During negotiations following the fight, Crassus was treacherously captured. Surena had heard that the Roman commander thirsted for wealth, so he had Crassus executed by pouring molten gold down his throat. most of the legionary eagles were captured by the Parthians, a disgrace that would rankle the Romans for years to come.</p>

"CnC-A 0410 - Philippi I" {
  10630
  <p>Caesar's assassination plunged the Roman world into chaos and civil war. On one side was the Second Triumvirate of Mark Antony, Aemilius Lepidus, and Octavian, Caesar's nephew, which aimed to avenge Caesar's murder. Opposing them were the assassins Marcus Brutus and Gaius Cassius, who sought to re-establish the Republic. The Republicans levied a large army in the east and set up camp near Philippi in Macedonia. With ample supplies, the fortified Republican position between two hills and a marsh seemed impregnable. When Mark Antony and Octavian arrived with their large veteran army, they camped a short distance from the Republicans' fortified position. Beset with supply problems, Antony constructed a causeway through the marsh and only then attacked. Capturing the high ground forced Cassius to weaken his front. Brutus marched out to take Antony in the flank, and Octavian in turn marched forward to engage Brutus' forces. Brutus' Republican legions defeated Octavian's forces and captured his camp. Meanwhile, Cassius lost his camp to Antony's outflanking force. Falsely believing Brutus had also been defeated, Cassius committed suicide. The battle ended with both sides overextended and each returned to their original lines to wait for another day to decide who would win.</p>

Brutus was content to watch the army of Antony and Octavian starve. However, the Republican legionnaires wanted to fight and Brutus tried and failed to convince his troops to wait. Brutus, a poorer general than Cassius, gave in when his men became restless and lined up for battle.</p><p>Brutus, commanding the right wing of his army, drove the enemy's left under Antony back, with the help of the more numerous Republican cavalry. The Republican center and left wing had to extend to avoid being outflanked. Octavian attacked and the Republican center quickly gave ground and eventually broke. The victorious Octavian then turned and took Brutus in the flank. Brutus fled and later killed himself. The Triumvirs had won this round of the civil war, but would later turn against each other.</p>

  <p>After his victory at Philippi, Mark Antony was intent on waging war against the Parthians and avenging the defeat at Carrhae. Antony sent Publius Ventidius Baussus ahead to pave the way. Ventidius was one of the most successful Roman generals who fought the Parthians. His use of ranged weapon troops and terrain to combat the Parthian cavalry gave him several victories.</p><p>Ventidius marched into Syria and encountered Quintus Labienus, a renegade Republican officer who had served under Brutus and then joined the Parthians. Ventidius gave chase, tracking Labienus down at the Cilician Gates, the main pass through the Taurus Mountains that separated Cilicia from Anatolia. Ventidius made camp on the heights while Labienus, expecting Parthian reinforcements, camped a short distance from the away. The Parthian cavalry under Pacorus soon arrived. Utterly fearless of the Romans, the Parthian horsemen did not wait to join Labienus but instead directly charged the heights. The Roman force, well supplied with missile troops and benefitted from the terrain, repulsed the attack and drove off the Parthians. The surviving Parthians fled to the Labienus' camp. Labienus avoided the fight and managed to escape again after dark. The way was now clear for Antony to invade Mesopotamia.</p>

  <p>Fresh from his dalliance with Cleopatra, Antony set out to conquer the Parthian empire, following a battle plan he discussed years before with Caesar. Avoiding Crassus' mistake of striking directly through Mesopotamia, Antony took his massive army north through Armenia. Always impetuous, Antony refused to wait for his baggage wagons and siege equipment and marched with his main army to Phraaspa, the Royal City of Media, leaving Oppius Statianus in charge of the siege train with a fairly large security force. When king Phraates heard about Antony's folly, he led a strong force of cavalry to attack the wagon train. Phraates' cavalry quickly surrounded the wagons, killed the guards, and destroyed the equipment. Antony could not capture Phraaspa without his siege equipment. Despite winning a few minor skirmishes, Antony was forced to withdraw from Media in the winter, suffering extremely heavy losses to both Parthian attacks and the harsh weather.</p>

  <p>In 43 AD, Aulus Plautius led an expedition of four legions to Britain. His army advanced with only minor skirmishing as far as Rutupiae on the coast of Kent. Late in the season, Roman scouts finally found the enemy camped on the northern bank of the River Medway. Togodumnus and Caratacus, the commanders of the Briton tribes, believed the river would halt the Roman advance. They were taken by surprise when a force of specially trained auxiliaries (described as "Celtic" in one account) swam the river and attacked the British charioteers. The Britons, while preoccupied with the auxiliaries, were again surprised when Legion II Augusta, under Vespasian suddenly crossed the river (probably using a pontoon bridge) and established a second bridgehead. The remaining legions began crossing to reinforce Legion II Augusta.</p><p>During the night, the Britons turned all their strength on the legions, knowing they were the bigger threat. The Briton assault penetrated the Roman lines, putting the bridgehead in great danger. Just then, Hosidius Geta led a legion that had just crossed the river in daring counter attack. Geta's force broke through the enemy's line and saved the bridgehead (which earned him a "triumph," very unusual for someone not a consul). The defeated Britans disengaged and withdrew back to the Thames.</p>

"CnC-A 0415 - Boudica's Revols, Watling Street" {
  10630
  <p>While many of the tribes of Britain resisted Rome until they were conquered and crushed, a few tribes, like the Iceni, formed pacts with the Romans to remain semi-independent. The Iceni client-king Prasutagus died while the Roman govenor, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was campaigning in what is now northern Wales. In Suetonius' absence, the procurator, Catus Decianus, took advantage of these event to seize lands, recall loans, and generally revoke all the advantages the clients had obtained from Claudius. When Prasutagus' widow, Boudica, complained, she was flogged and her young daughters raped in front of her. Instead of suppressing dissent these barbarous acts fanned the fires of revolt. The Iceni, Trinovantes, and others rose up, sacking the legion colony of Camulodunum, defeating several small Roman forces, burning Londinium and Verulamium (St. Albans), and killing as many as 70,000 people.</p><p>Suetonius summoned reinforcements from all over Britain until he was strong enough to fight on a carefully selected defensive position offering a narrow front that would minimize the enemy numbers. Flushed with success, Boudica's Celtic host may have numbered as many as 50,000 fighting men, followed by their families and baggage wagons loaded with plunder. She deployed these wagons at the rear of her army. The men would fight all the harder knowing that their families were watching and would be in grave danger if the Romans triumphed. The Britons lauched a massive frontal attack. Suetonius held his forces in place. As the charging Britons neared the Roman line, they were staggered and stopped by a storm of pila. Only then did the Romans attack the confused Britons, driving them back onto their wagons and cutting them down by the thousands. Boudica managed to escape, but later committed suicide rather than be captured. The exact location of the battle is uncertain, but most commonly held to have taken place at what the Anglo-Saxons called "Watling Street," hence the anachronistic name.</p>

  <p>The "year of four emperors" (68-69 AD) began when Nero, the last member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, committed suicide to avoid execution. Servius Sulpicius Galba, governor of Hispania, was proclaimed emperor, but did not last long, for Marcus Salvius Otho, with the support of the Praetorian Guard, murdered Galba and became the second emperor. Meanwhile, the governor of Germany, Aulus Vitellius, also claimed the throne and marched on Rome with his veteran legions and a strong force of Batavian auxiliaries. Otho left Rome with the Praetorian Guard, nearly three loyal legions and a force of gladiators to meet the challenge.</p><p>After making camp near Brixellum, Otho decided to call his brother Titianus from Rome and act as his field commander for the upcoming battle. Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, who had defeated Boudica some eight years prior, advised Titianus to wait for reinforcements, but Titianus ignored the advice and led the army out to fight at once. The two Roman armies met at Bedriacum, near Cremona, and heavy fighting took place as legionary eagles were captured and recaptured. Otho's army eventually gave way when the large force of Batavian auxiliaries took them in the flank. The Othonian troops fled back to their camp and the next day took an oath of allegiance to Vitellius, while Otho committed suicide. Vitellius now became the third of the four emperors in this fateful year, but his reign would not last till the end of the year. Titus Flavius Vespasian, with the support of the eastern and Danubian legions, seized the throne and finally established stabel rule.</p>

  <p>After years of campaigns in northern Britain, Gnaeus Julius Agricola subdued all the tribes except the fierce Caledonians. Agricola maneuvered to bring the Caledonians to open battle. Determined to restore the security of his Highland home, the Caledonian chief, Calgacus, gathered a strong force of about 30,000 and awaited the Romans at Mons Graupius. Calgacus occupied the high ground with his main force and posted a line of chariots on level ground to threir front. The Roman army was of roughly equal size. Agricola deployed his auxiliary infantry and cavalry in the main battle line and held his legions in reserve.</p><p>The battle opened with Agricola's cavalry charge against the barbarian chariots while the infantry moved forward and engaged in an exchange of missiles with the enemy. When the charioteers began to give ground, the Roman auxiliary infantry closed to hand-to-hand combat, which drove the enemy line back. A desperate attempt to outflank the Roman line was turned back by another cavalry charge. The outcome was considered remarkable because solely auxiliary forces had achieved the victory. Following the battle, Agricola proclaimed that all tribes in Britain had been conquered.</p>

"CnC-A 0418 - Issus" {
  10630
  <p>The Roman Empire lacked an accepted institutional system of succession whenever an emperor died. This typically led to multiple claimants to the throne and civil war. So, when the erratic and eccentric emperor Commodus was murdered in 193 AD, it ushered in just such a period, sometimes called the "Year of the Five Emperors." Pertinax was proclaimed emperor but, after a reign of only 83 days, he was murdered by his own Praetorian guards. The Praetorians auctioned the throne off to a rich senator, Julianius Didianus. Meanwhile three field commanders claimed the throne - Septimus Severus in Pannonia, Pescennius Niger in Syria, and Clodius Albinus in Britain. Septimus Severus reached Rome first with his veteran legions, executed Didianus, and punished the treacherous Praetorian guards. Before marching to face Niger in the east, Severus convinced Albinus that he could be his co-ruler and heir.</p><p>Severus met Niger's forces in Syria, near the River Issus in 194 AD. Having a numerical advantage, Serverus attacked frontally while sending the bulk of his cavalry around a large wood on his left to outflank the enemy's battle line. The initial frontal assault failed to break Niger's line but Severus' cavarly, after overpowering Niger's cavalry on the left, broke through onto the enemy infantry. Niger's army was now trapped between Serverus' two forces and it was destroyed. Niger was killed while attempting to escape to Parthia. Severus would still have to face Albinus to consolidate his rule.</p>

"CnC-A 0419 - Lugdunum" {
  10630
  <p>The civil war that began with the "year of the five emperors" continued. Septimus Severus, after defeating Pescennius Niger at Issus (194), now turned on his other rival, Clodius Albinus, governor of Britain. Albinus took his legions east and added the forces of Novius Rufus, governor of Hispania. He set up camp near Lugdunum, in Gaul. Albinus attempted to invade Italy through the Alpine passes, but Severus prevented the move by garrisoning the passes. Albinus returned to Lugdunum. Serverus followed with an army of about the same size as Albinus.</p><p>The details of the battle are somewhat vague, but it was a long and bloody fight. It seems that Severus' left was disordered when it encountered rough ground and the troops sent to support them were driven back. On Severus's right the Albinus troops broke and were pursued back to their camp, which was taken and looted. In the center, the tide shifted many times. Finally the battle swung decisively in Severus's favor as his cavalry advantage proved itself. Albinus attempted to escape but was caught and beheaded. Severus went on to rule as emperor for nearly two decades.</p>

"CnC-A 0420 - Nisibis" {
  10630
  <p>For centuries, Rome and Parthia contended for dominance in the Middle East. Nisibit 217 AD was a three-day battle with the Romans led by their new emperor Marcus Opellius Macrinus against the Great King of Parthia, Artabanus IV. On the first day, the battle began when conflict arose among the soldiers for possession of a watering place. Macrinus deployed his Romans in their typical formation, infantry in the center and cavalry at the wings. The formation also had gaps in the line to allow the light infantry to skirmish forward and withdraw to safety when necessary. The Parthian army was strong in cavalry and horse archers, and at sunrise the cavalry and cataphract camels attempted to close with the Roman line. But, when the Roman light infantry evaded, they strew the ground with caltrops (spiked balls) and the pursuers found themselves in a difficult situation. After several such assaults and night drawing near, both armies retired to their camps. The second day was a repeat of the first day, with skirmishing from morning to night but again no clear advantage to either side. On day three, the Parthian army attempted to use their greater numbers to surround the Romans. The Romans succeeded in extending their line using the light cavalry and light troops to protect their flanks. By the end of the third day, both armies had suffered severely and were exhausted. Under these circumstances, Macrinus opened negotiations with Artabanus and bought peace with some territorial concessions.</p>

"CnC-A 0421 - Hormuz" {
  10630
  <p>Around 220 AD Ardashir I, a Persian vassal, considered the state of the Parthian Empire. Ardashir knew about dissensions in the Parthian royal house and reasoned that the losses which Artabanus had sustained in his battles with the Romans and against his brother Vologases had weakened Parthian military power. He decided the time was right to declare the independence of Persia. Artabanus did not take any immediate steps to respond, which allowed Ardashir's rebellion to spread. Then Artabanus sent a provincial governor of Khuzestan to deal with the Persian, but Ardashir defeated this expedition. Finally, Artabanus himself led the remnants of the royal Parthian army into Persia. This invasion resulted in three battles. The final and decisive battle took place in the plain of Hormuz, between the Rivers Bebahan and Shuster. The Parthian cavalry army faced a balanced Persian army of cavalry and infantry. Artabanus was slain in the battle and his army completely defeated. With Artabanus' death, the Parthian Arsacid dynasty ended after ruling for 473 years. Ardashir's victory established a new Persian dynasty, the Sassanids, who would rule for another four centuries.</p>

"CnC-A 0422 - Carthage" {
  10630
  <p>In 235 AD, the Roman army in Germany mutinied and murdered the last Severan emperor, Alexander Severus, after a reign of fourteen years. This led to another succession crisis and civil war. The legions in Germany acclaimed a professional soldier, Maximus Thrax, as the new emperor. Maximus' harsh rule alienated the Senate and populace of Rome. Then in 238 AD, the aged governor of the province of Africa, Gordanius I, was acclaimed co-emperor with his son, Gordanius II, by rebel forces. The Roman Senate quickly switched its allegiance to Gordanius. The father and son hastily raised an army in Africa. Capelianus, the governor of Numidia, remained loyal to Emperor Maximus. He was in command of the only legion in the region at this time, the III Augusta. The two armies met near Carthage with Gordianus II leading his army of untrained troops against Capelianus' veteran Legion III Augusta and other units. During the battle Gordianus II was killed and his army soundly defeated. Gordianus I committed suicide upon learning of his son's death. Maximus benefited only briefly from his lieutenant's victory, as the rebellion of the Roman senate continued. The Praetorian guards assassinated Maximus, and the grandson of Gordanius I was chosed by the Senate as the new emperor. Gordianus III would rule for seven years.</p>

"CnC-A 0423 - Abrittus" {
  10630
  <p>After repeated incursions into Moesia and Dacia by the Goths under Cniva, the Roman Emperor Gaius Messius Quintus Decius (often called "Trajan Decius") moved to confront the barbarian invaders. Accompanied by his son Herennius Etruscus and his general Trebonianus Gallus, Decius led a major military expedition into the lower Danube, where he forced Cniva with his main army to abandon the siege of Nicopolis. Decius and the Romans pursued Cniva through difficult terrain and after a series of forced marches caught Cniva near Abrittus. The Battle of Abrittus is also known as the Battle of Forum Terebronii.</p><p>Cniva had divided his forces prior to the battle, and even though the Romans easily defeated the enemy front line, when they pursued the retreating enemy into the swamps, Cniva's concealed forces attacked. Cniva's tactical maneuver proved to be very successful and the Romans were surprised and slaughtered. Decius' son Herennius was killed early in the battle, but the emperor proclaimed that "the death of one soldier is not a great loss to the republic" and continued fighting. Decius himself was slain soon thereafter, gaining the distinction of being the first Roman emperor killed in battle against a foreign enemy.</p><p>After the battle, Trebonianus Gallus was acclaimed the new emperor. With his army shattered, Gallus was forced to allow Cniva to leave his spoils and promised to pay tribute in order to keep the Goths from invading the empire again.</p>

  <p>The battle of Edessa was another round in the on-going Roman-Persian Wars. In 258, Shapur I, King of Sassanid Persia invaded Roman territory, overrunning Armenia and continuing into Syria. In order to stop his repleated plundering, in 259, Emperor Valerian led a Roman army (including the Praetorian Guard) into Syria. After some initial success in restoring the lost provinces, he met the main Persian army near Edessa, in Mesopotamia, commanded by King Shapur I.</p><p>The Roman army was strong in legionary infantry, while the Persian force had superior cavalry. However, the Persian army also fielded a number of war elephants. Shapur initiated the battle with a charge by his lumbering pachyderms into the center of the Roman line. Confusion and panic followed, for the Roman's techniques to counter these beasts had long been forgotten. A massive Persian cavalry charge then forced the Romans to withdraw. Valerian and most of the army were surrounded and ultimately captured. The way was now clear for Shapur and his Persian host to sweep back through Syria and into Asia Minor.</p>

  <p>The Goths, a Germanic people, were migrating southward and crossed the Roman frontier in the province of Pannonia. The emperor Gallienus, fresh from his victory over another Germanic tribe, the Alemanni, managed to check the Goth's advance early in the year, but he could not expel the Goths, and they sacked several wealthy towns, that summer. Then Gallienus was murdered while on campaign against a pretender. The new emperor, Claudius II, led a second expedition against the Goths in the autumn of 268 AD with a more mobile army. His cavalry was commanded by the general Aurelian, who would later become the emperor.</p><p>As both armies deployed for battle, the advance guard of the Goths was cut to pieces by the Roman light cavalry, which withdrew to the flanks as the Goths, who had the advantage in numbers, charged the Roman center. The Roman infantry held against the charge, with the help of Aurelian's cavalry leadership. The Romans then advanced and drove what was left of the enemy's center back to their wagon laager. After being repulsed several times, the Romans set up a siege. Eventually, the Goths surrendered and thousands were taken prisoner. The defeat at Naissus broke the war power of the Goths and secured Rome's Danubian frontier for decades to come.</p>

"CnC-A 0426 - Placentia" {
  10630
  <p>Aurelian became emperor in 270, and is remembered as one of the "soldier-emperors" who restored the empire after its near collapse. During his five-year reign, Aurelian re-united the empire after two-thirds of the provinces had broken away from central control. But first, Aurelian had to repulse a number of barbarian invasions. The most serious threat was posed by the Alemanni, a Germanic tribe that had made frequent incursions into Roman territory. In 271 AD, after Aurelian had moved several of the western legions east to fight the Vandals and Goths, the Alemanni broke through the frontier forces and invaded Italia. The Alemanni horde first sacked the city of Placentia in northern Italia. Emperor Aurelian, who was in Pannonia (near present day Hungary) with an army to control the Vandals, had to move quickly back to Italia. The Alemanni learned of Aurelian's approach and set an ambush for the Roman Emperor. They achieved complete surprise and defeated the Romans. The Alemanni continued their advance toward the capital, which produced great fear and panic in Rome.</p>

The Alemanni were moving towards Rome, producing great fear in the city. Rome had grown beyond the old city walls and much of the city was completely exposed to enemy attack. Aurelian finally caught up to the rear of the Germanic horde and forced a fight near Fano. The Alemanni turned to fight just before crossing the Metaurus River which was their undoing. Pinned against the river, the Alemanni were unable to maneuver or give any ground. When the main Alemanni line broke, many of the tribal warriors were drowned as they attempted to retreat. The shattered remnants of the Alemanni now headed north, away from Rome, with Aurelian in hot pursuit.</p>

Aurelian had the mountain passes blocked and then proceeded to destroy almost the entire Alemanni army. Little is known about the tactical makeup of the battle, other than that the Alemanni were trying to get away and were almost completely wiped out. The victory ended the invasion and the Roman people granted Aurelian the title Germanicus Maximus. But the near success of the Alemanni made Aurelian realize that Rome needed better defenses. This new, much larger set of walls encompassed all of the seven hills and became known as the "Aurelian Walls," some of which can still be seen today.</p>

  <p>The Palmyrene Empire (260-273) consisted of the (former) eastern Roman provinces of Syria, Palestine, and large parts of Asia Minor. This breakaway kingdom was ruled by the famous Queen Zenobia and had won many victories over the Sassanids, while repelling the Romans at the same time. Queen Zenobia believed that she and her general Zabadas could take Egypt while the Romans were busy with the Germanic tribes of the north. In 272, Emperor Aurelian, fresh from his dramatic victory over the Alemanni, marched east to end the threat from Zenobia and restore the eastern provinces. After overrunning Syria, Aurelian met the main Palmyrene army at Immae, a short distance east of the city of Antioch.</p><p>The Battle of Immae began with a Palmyrene cataphract cavalry charge led by Zabadas. After a short struggle, the lighter Roman cavalry formation fell back into a marshy area. Here, as planned, the Roman infantry was waiting the now tired, disorganized cataphract cavalry, who routed and fled. Zenobia and her infantry made a stand on a series of hills until the Romans advanced and cut them apart. The queen and her general retreated to Antioch. After some additional campaigning, Aurelian captured and sacked Palmyra, bringing an end to Zenobia's empire and restoring the rule of Rome in the East.</p>

"CnC-A 0430 - Milvian Bridge" {
  10630
  <p>While emperor Diocletian's "Tetrarchy" system of shared power maintained calm for 20 years, eventually rivalries took over again. In 306 Maxentius proclaimed himself emperor, setting off another confused civil war. He gained great power when F.V. Septimus marched an army against him which defected before battle. In 312, Constantine decided to resolve the dispute with Maxentius (his brother-in-law!) for control of the Western Roman Empire. With an army drawn from his western provinces of Britain, Gaul, and the Rhine, Constantince invaded Italy. He defeated Maxentius at Taurinorum, and expected Maxentius to hold out in Rome (as he had successfully done several times before) but instead he made a stand less than ten miles from Rome, in front of the Milvian Bridge crossing the Tiber River.</p><p>Maxentius' deployment was faulty, as his huge army was much too close to the Tiber River to allow room to maneuver. Although out-numbered, Constantine's army attacked first and succeeded in pushing Maxentius's forces back toward the river, with Constantine personally leading his Gallic cavalry forward. Seeing that the battle was going badly, Maxentius ordered his army to retreat and seek safety behind Rome's strong walls, but the planned withdrawal degenerated into a rout as the retreating troops bunched up at the Milvian Bridge. Even Maxentius could not cross at the bridge and drowned. Constantine marched into Rome after the victory and was declared the sole Western Roman Augustus. Constantine later claimed a dream told him he would succeed "under this sign" (which various sources call the cross or the Chi-Rho sign) and this victory aided the rise of Christianity as Rome's state religion.</p>

  <p>In the years after Milvian Bridge, Constantine gradually consolidated his military superiority. Licinius emerged as Constantine's chief rival. After defeating Daia, Licinius gained control over the entire eastern half of the Roman Empire. Relations between the Constantine and Licinius gradually deteriorated. Upon learning that Licinius was conspiring against him, Constantine marched east and the two armies met about 200 miles within the territory of Licinius, near Cibalae in Pannonia. Licinius's army took up a position of the edge of a plain, intending to attack Constantine as he emerged from a narrow passage through hilly country and swamps. Constantine, however, covered his deployment with light cavalry and gained maneuvering space. The battle lasted from dawn to dusk. It ended when Licinius's left wing gave way and his army withdrew under the cover of darkness. Licinius was forced to flee to Sirmium.</p><p>After losing a second battle to Constantine, Licinius conceded his Balkan provinces to Constantine in exchange for a cessation of hostilities. In a second civil war with Licinius (323-324), Constantine finally re-united the Roman Empire under the rule of one man for the first time in over three decades.</p>

"CnC-A 0110 - Marathon" {
  10630
  <p>King Darius I of Persia sent an expedition against Athens in reprisal for the burning of Sardes in 498 BC during the failed Ionian Revolt. The Persian fleet unter the joint command of Datis and Artaphernes landed near Marathon bay, which offered a perfect battleground for their troops. The Athenians marched out to face the enemy in the field, with 1000 allied soldiers from Plataea supplementing the Athenian force of 9000. The Persians outnumbered the Greeks, but to counter the disparity, Callimachus extended the Greek line to match the enemy, thinning the center while keeping both wings at full strength. The Persian army, with its best troops in the center, was taken by surprise when the Athenians attacked. Historians suggest that some of the Persian cavalry was in the process of embarking back onto the ships when the attack started. In the battle the Persian center got the best of the weak Greek center and broke through, but this success was more than countered by the defeat of their two wings. The victorious Athenians then swung inwards and the Persian force was routed back to their ships. Concerned that the defeated Persians might still sail around to threated Athens, Pheidippides ran the 26 miles back to Athens with the news of the victory, running the first Marathon race. Greece was safe, for now.</p>

  <p>Phoenicia and Greece both colonized the western Mediterranean. Carthage unified the Punic cities into an empire, while the Syracuse rose to become the leading Greek city under its first Tyrant, Gelon. With Theron of Akragas, Gelon took control of Himera and drove out the former ruler, Terillus, in 483. King Hamilcar of Carthage, an ally and friend of Terillus, led an army to Sicily in 480 BC to restore him to power. Hamilcar established two camps to the west and southwest of Himera. As the armies skirmished outside the city, Gelon's raiders captured a message providing the date of arrival of a body of Greek cavarly reinforcing Hamilcar's army. A treacherous plan was hatched to substitute Gelon's own cavalry for these reinforcements. At dawn on the specified day, Gelon's horsemen entered the Punic sea-camp without raising any suspicion. They suddenly attacked, raising havoc and killing Hamilcar. Meanwhile the rest of Gelon's army launched a surprise attack against both camps. Most of the forces in the sea-camp were slaughtered but a successful counter-attack at the hill camp prevented the total destruction of the Carthaginian army. A peace treaty was signed between Syracuse and Carthage, which held for seven decades. Since Hamilcar's expedition coincided with the Xerxes' invasion, it was believed to be part of a coordinated assault on the Greek world.</p>

Amid much bickering, an allied Greek army was formed under the Spartan Pausanias, and moved to oppose the Persians. The Greeks were always careful to stay in terrain that negated the Persian cavalry. The Persian cavalry attacked anyway, but their commander Masistias was killed. Ceasing direct combat, the Persian cavalry began raiding effectively, poisoning the Greek's water supply and destroying a large Greek baggage train. Short of water and food, Pausanias ordered a night withdrawal, but only the allies in the center did so. The Spartan right and Athenian left stood until first light. Seeing this confusion Mardonius ordered a general advance, and attacked the Athenians units on the Greek left wing. It was a fierce onslaught that prevented the Athenians from moving to assist the Spartans who were being pressed hard on the right. Holding back until the omens were right, the Spartans were finally ordered to charge, routing all before them and killing Mardonius. The sight of Persians retreating unnerved Artabazus' forces and they also fled the field. The victory at Plataea meant the Persian threat to Greece was effectively ended.</p>

"CnC-A 0113 - Leuctra" {
  10630
  <p>Sparta's victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War (431 - 404) cemented the reputation of her hoplites as the premier infantry force in the world. However, Spartan arrogance following this victory led to the outbreak of hostilities with her former ally, Thebes. In 371 King Cleombrotos of Sparta marched against Thebes. When he reached Leuctra he found the Theban army barred his way. The Spartans deployed in a long line with their allies on the left. Greek commanders traditionally placed their best troops on the right, and this wing usually led the attack. The brilliant Theban commander, Epaminondas,devised an innovative plan to mass his best men on the left in a 50-man deep phalanx. He intended to meet Spartan shock with super shock. Both sides sent their cavalry out and the Spartan horse were quickly defeated. Seeing his cavalry fail, Cleombrotos ordered his infantry to advance. Simultaneously, Epaminondas' massed left advanced against the Spartan right, while the rest of his army was ordered to hold back, in an oblique order. The Spartans were attempting to change formation to deal with the situation when the Sacred Band charged and hit them in mid-maneuver. Cleombrotos was killed and the massive weight of the Theban phalanx broke the Spartan line. Never before had Sparta experienced such a defeat, and Leuctra shattered the myth of Spartan military invincibility.</p>

"CnC-A 0114 - Mantinea" {

  <p>Thebes' shocking victory at Leuctra (371) had ended the Spartan hegemony over Greece. Epaminondas then organized the Arcadian League of cities in the Peloponnesus, in order to counter-balance Sparta and ensure Theban supremacy. A division in the Arcadian league led Mantinea to ally with Sparta. Sparta's hereditary enemy, Athens, even joined in the alliance against Thebes. Epaminondas invaded in 362 to reassert Theban dominance. In a plain near Mantinea he encountered the enemy force fo 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse with the Mantineans on the right, Spartans in the center, and Athenians on the left. Epaminondas' force of 30,000 foot and 3,000 horse was deployed with massive depth on his left, the same tactic he had used successfully at Leuctra. The Thebans closed in on the Mantinean wing and then grounded arms as if not to battle this day. Once the Mantineans relaxed their guard, Epaminondas suddenly ordered the attack. The onslaught broke the Mantinean right flank, leading to the defeat of the entire Spartan army. Disastrously for Thebes, Epaminondas was killed in the closing moments of the battle. Sparta had been humbled again, but without her brilliant leader, Thebes was unable to maintain her hegemony over Greece. The ultimate result was a weakening of Greece that paved the way for the Macedonian conquest.</p>

"CnC-A 0115 - Crocus Plain" {
  10630
  <p>In 359 BC, Philip became king of Macedon. As a youth he had been a hostage in Thebes, where he observed the innovations of Epaminondas. Applying these lessons, Philip created a combined arms force of a maneuverable phalanx, cavalry and light troops. He re-armed his phalanx with 17-foot pikes instead of the usual 9-foot spears. Philip aggressively expanded Macedonian control which brought him into conflict with the Athenians. In 352, Philip turned southwest into Thessaly. The Greek Phocian army under Onomarchus arrived at Crocus Plain with 20,000 foot and 500 horse to stop him. Onomarchus deployed with his back to the Pagasaean Gulf. Philip with the same number of foot and 3,000 horse, attacked. Onomarchus' army fought with surprising resilience holding off the Macedonian phalanx until flanked by Philip's cavalry. The Phocian lines began to withdraw and then broke and fled to the sea where many tried to swim out to the Athenian fleet that had just arrived. Onomarchus died fighting, and Macedon now dominated all of Thessaly. Philip had demonstrated the superiority of a combined arms force against a traditional Greek hoplite army. The irresistible Macedonian expansion into Greek would continue.</p>

"CnC-A 0116 - Granicus" {

  <p>Alexander succeeded his father in 336 BC, and after securing control of Macedon and the other Greek states, he marched east to challenge the Persian Empire. He crossed the Hellespont into Asia with about 32,000 infantry and 5,100 cavalry. Darius III, emperor of Persia, did not act in time to prevent the crossing and ordered his Satraps (governors) and generals to assemble their forces near the Granicus River. The Persian cavalry were deployed along the bank and the infantry some distance to the rear. Alexander placed his heavy infantry in the center and light infantry and cavalry on the wings. Parmenio commanded the defensive left and Alexander the overloaded right. The initial Macedonian attack across the river was repulsed. Alexander then led the Companion cavalry in a ferocious assault on the Persian leaders who were now grouped closely together. Mithridates, Darius' nephew, struch the Macedonian king with a javelin, but Alexander slew him with a sword stroke. Phoesaces then managed to deliver a blow that split Alexander's helmet. As Alexander struck Rhoesaces down, Spithradates came from behind and raised his scimitar to finish off the Macedonian king. However, Alexander's bodyguard Cleitus struck the Persian noble with such power that he severed his arm. The death of these three leaders was too much for the Persian cavalry and they broke and fled. So did the Persian foot. Only the Greek mercenaries held their ground. When they asked for quarters, none was given, and they were butchered almost to the man. Asia Minor was now ripe for Macedonian conquest.</p>

"CnC-A 0117 - Issus" {
  10630
  <p>After the battle of Granicus River, Darius assembled a new army near Babylon while Alexander overran Asia Minor. Darius advanced into Syria to await the Macedonian invader. However, when Alexander's advance was delayed due to his illness, Darius maneuvered his forces around behind the Macedonian army and overran his supply base. Alexander turned to meet Darius at the Pinarus River. Darius' army was deployed defensively behind the river, with light-armed units on the hills on his left, Greek mercenaries in the center and the majority of his cavalry on his right under Narbazanes. Alexander took command of the Companion Cavalry on the right, deployed his phalanx in the center and sent the Thessalian cavalry under Parmenio to the left flank to hold out against the massed Persian horse. Alexander's advance was slow at first, but when he realized the Persian units in the hills were no threat, he ordered the charge toward the Greek mercenaries. The Macedonian phalanx initially had a tough time against Darius' Greek mercenaries, but Alexander broke through with his Companions and took the mercenaries in the flank. The Persian center rapidly collapsed and Darius fled the field. A fierce, evenly matched cavalry battle near the shore turned into a Persian rout when the horsemen saw Darius take flight. Persia had lost two armies, and Alexander now had access into the heart of the empire.</p>

"CnC-A 0118 - Gaugamela" {
  10630
  <p>Rather than pursue Darius after the victory at Issus (333), Alexander turned south to neutralize the Persian fleet. In a two-year campaign he captured Tyre and Gaza, and conquered Egypt. In 331, Alexander marched into Mesopotamia, intent on attacking Babylon. Darius had raised another army, strong in cavalry but lacking in good infantry. The two armies met on the plain of Gaugamela. Darius posted cavalry on the right and the left, and occupied the center with his Greek mercenaries, guard cavarly, elephants and chariots. Alexander placed the Thessalian horse on the left, while taking charge of the phalanx in the center and the Companions on the right in person. The Persian line extended well beyond both flanks of the Macedonian formation. To counter, Alexander moved diagonally as he advanced, refusing his left. Darius ordered his mounted troops forward. The Macedonian right managed to hold their attackers just long enough for Alexander to charge with his Companions and heavy infantry straight for Darius. Again, Darius turned and fled the field, but the battle was not quite over. The Macedonian left was still hard pressed by the Persian cavalry. Alexander wheeled about and charged with the Companions into the Persians, forcing them back. Soon the entire Persian army was in retreat. Gaugamela is one of the truly decisive battles of history, and marked the beginning of Alexander's great empire. This battle is also considered the classic example of pentration tactics.</p>

"CnC-A 0119 - Jaxartes River" {
  10630
  <p>By 329 BC Alexander had completed the subjugation of the eastern Persian satraps, and his army was building a new city, Alexandria Eschate, on the banks of the Jaxartes, to guard his north-eastern frontier. A Scythian force under their chief, Satraces, arrived on the opposite bank. The Scythian force was mostly horse-archers who were about to launch a major raid. Alexander decided to attack and defeat the barbarians to dissuade them from future raids. Alexander set up catapults to deal with the horse-archers during their potentially difficult river crossing. When the catapults opened fire, a number of Scythian horsemen were immediately struck down. The horse-archers cautiously backed away from the river. Alexander's troops quickly crossed en masse. Once safely across, he sent out a few units of horse and foot as bait. When the Scythians, as expected, had surrounded the Macedonian detachment, Alexander sent in the rest of his horse and light infantry to block their retreat so they could not avoid Alexander's heavy foot units. After some brief hand-to-hand fighting, Satraces was killed and the Scythians broke and fled. Although the bulk of the Scythian army escaped, they knew that the Macedonians could beat their tactics. Alexander had succeeded in forcing a victory against the swift steppe horse-archers where Cyrus the Great and Darius I had failed.</p>

"CnC-A 0120 - Hydaspes" {
  10630
  <p>Having gained control over all of the known civilized world, Alexander ventured into India in 326 BC. He met resistance from Porus at the River Hydaspes. Porus' large corps of 200 elephants thwarted all of Alexander's attempts to cross the river. Learning that a lare force was moving to reinforce Porus, Alexander decisively divided his army, and secretly crossed up-river with the majority of the Macedonian troops. Craterus remained in place with a large detachment to deceive the Indians. Upon receiving the startling news that Alexande had crossed the Hydaspes, Porus hurriedly turned his army to meet him in battle. Porus sent his chariots forward but these were quickly destroyed. Alexander then sent his cavalry to attack Porus' right wing and gained the flank of the Indian army, while his heavy infantry advanced to attack the elephants and bowmen. The elephants charged the phalanx and did great execution among the elite Macedonian infantry. Only the timely intervention of the light troops prevented greater loss. Porus, wounded six times, was captured and the remainder of his army routed. Porus so impressed Alexander with his bravery that he was allowed to retain his kingdom as a Macedonian vassal. The power of the elephants was not lost upon the Macedonian generals who fought at Hydaspes. They would go to great pains to obtain elephants of their own during the Wars of the Successors.</p>

"CnC-A 0121 - Hellespont" {
  10630
  <p>Alexander's death in 323 BC threw his empire into a state of political and military turmoil, with his generals and governors claiming independent kingdoms as his "Successors" (the Diadochia). Perdiccas inherited the main Macedonian army and the title 'regent of the Asiatic Empire.' A coalition of other successors formed against him. An army under Craterus was sent to Asia to confront Perdiccas and his allies. Perdiccas sent Eumenes and Neoptolemus with an army to the Hellespont to prevent Craterus from crossing into Asia. Neoptolemus, jealous of Eumenes, deserted with a few hundred horse and joined forces with Craterus. After crossing, when Craterus and Eumenes met, each had around 20,000 infantry but Craterus' phalanx of veteran Macedonians was superior. Eumenes relied on his more numerous cavalry. Both sides stationed their phalanx in the center and cavalry on the wings. Craterus, commanding the right wing, charged at the onset. He was slain, and his cavalry scattered. On the other wing, Neoptolemus confronted Eumenes, and in single combat, Neoptolemus was killed. Craterus' infantry, by now surrounded and leaderless, surrendered. Eumenes invited the defeated Macedonians to join him. They agreed, but took off by night to rejoin Antipater, the regent of Greece and Macedonia. The Battle of the Hellespont removed two contenders, but the War of the Successors would go on for another 40 years.</p>

"CnC-A 0122 - Paraitacene" {
  10630
  <p>By 318 BC the Successors had formed two competing alliances: the 'Royalists' who claimed to fight to maintain the empire for Alexander's infant sons, and a rival coalition that sought to claim their own independent kingdoms. The opposing Successor Armies in Asia -- one commanded by Antigonus, the other by Eumenes -- met in battle at Paraitacene in 317 BC. Antigonus was by now the most powerful of the Diadochi, controlling most of Anatolia and the eastern satrapies. Eumenes had the backing of Alexander's heirs and a large war chest, though the fact that he was a Greek and not a Macedonian was a major handicap. Antigonus fielded 28,000 infantry and 11,000 horse. Eumenes' force of 35,000 foot and 6,000 horse included the veteran Silver Shields who had fought with distinction in all of Alexander's campaigns. The battle opened with Antigonus' light horse attacking Eumenes right. This attack was wrecked by Eumenes' heavy cavalry. Meanwhile in the center, the Silver Shields drove back Antigonus' phalanx. Antigonus' army was on the ropes when he pulled off a stroke that evened the score. He charged through a gap and was successful in routing Eumenes' left flank. Both sides at this point were exhausted and returned to their camps. Antigonus claimed victory but realistically the battle was a draw and a final resolution would be at Gabiene, a year later.</p>

  <p>After Paraitacene in 317, Eumenes was desperately trying to keep the united Empire of Alexander alive for his heirs. The following year, Antigonus emerged early from winter quarters and force marched across the desert to catch Eumenes off guard. Eumenes detected the move and the two armies closed on a salt plain near Gabiene. Antigonus' force had 22,000 infantry, 9,000 horse and 65 elephants. Eumenes' army was down to 17,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry and 114 elephants. Both sides deployed in a classic Alexandrian set up. The battle opened with the skirmishers and elephants engaging in a confused melee. Antigonus' cavalry charged home against Eumenes' left wing cavalry, routing it. In the center Eumenes' Silver Shields prevailed again in an infantry attack that forced back the Antigonid phalanx. Meanwhile, Antigonus' cavalry force was pressing in on both flanks and also captured Eumenes' baggage train (camp). It had been another close battle but Antigonus had prevailed. Antigonus negotiated with the Silver Shields to exchange their commander for their captured baggage, and Eumenes was betrayed and put to death. Antigonus was now the undisputed leader of the Asian satrapies, and would soon make a bid to reclaim all of the Empire of Alexander for himself.</p>

  10630
  <p>By 309 BC, all of Alexander's heirs had been executed. The Successors ended the pretense of fighting for the restauration of the empire, and proclaimed themselves kings. With the most powerful army of all the contenders, Antigonus made a bid to reunify the empire under his dominion in 302 BC. The other four Diadochi kings had formed an alliance to stop him. The allies met Antigonus' army near Ipsus. The armies were evenly matched in foot, with the allies superior in horse and greatly superior in elephants. As the battle began, Antigonus' cavalry charged against one of Seleucus' cavalry wings, routing it. Unfortunately, the Antigonid cavalry pursued too far, and then could not re-enter the battle because they were blocked by Seleucid elephants. This left Antigonus' phalanx unsupported as the allied phalanx charged forward. Overwhelmed, Antigonus was killed and his phalanx broken. The remaining horse and some of the foot escaped, along with a young general who would make his presence felt later -- Pyrrhus. With three kings and three future kings present, this had truly been "the Battle of the Kings." The 81-year old Antigonus had never before lost a battle. His defeat and death brought an end to the first phase of the Successor Wars and dashed any hope that the empire would be reunified.</p>

"CnC-A 0125 - Heraclea" {
  10630
  <p>As a youth, Pyrrhus of Epirus served as a lieutenant under the Diadochi, including Demetrius and Ptolemy. In 297 BC he regained his ancestral kingdom, and went on to seize the throne of Macedon. By 284 he was driven out of Macedon, and looking for new adventures. When Rome threatened expansion in southern Italy, Pyrrhus accepted an invitation from Tarentum to lead their fight in 281 BC. His campaign started badly when his invasion army of 25,000 foot, 3,000 horse and 20 elephants was scattered in its sea crossing, and he discovered a "wait and see" attitude among his erstwhile Greek allies in Italy. Pyrrhus needed a quick victory to change their attitude. Laevinus moved south to deal with the Epirote invader with a Roman army of two legions and allies -- about 25,000 men. Both armies met near the river Siris. Pyrrhus could not prevent the Romans from crossing. In the early stage of the battle the Romans were getting the best of it, when Pyrrhus played his trump card and sent forward the elephants. No Roman soldier had seen one before and they were too much for the foot and cavalry alike. The Roman rout was on. There is little doubt the elephants were the key to Pyrrhus' victory, but it had been a bloody and hard-fought battle -- 7,000 Romans and 4,000 Greeks were left on the field. The victory swelled Pyrrhus' ranks with new allies, but Rome was far from beaten.</p>

  <p>Pyrrhus of Epirus nearly doubled the size of his army after the victory at Heraclea wih Greeks, Samnites and Lucanians flocking to his standard. After absorbing the new recruits, Pyrrhus set off towards Rome. His advance was stopped at Asculum by the two Roman Consuls Decius and Sulpicius, and their army of four legions and allies. Both sides had around 40,000 men, but Pyrrhus had the advantage in cavarly and, of course, his elephants. After a day of skirmishing in rough terrain, the two armies lined up at daybreak on level ground. What followed was a straight-forward Legion versus Phalanx battle. During the battle Pyrrhus failed to envelope the Roman flanks. After a hard fight in the center, the Romans were driven back once again by his elephants. Pyrrhus, at the forefront of the fighting, was wounded, preventing him from exploiting his victory. Over 6,000 Romans had been slain, but Pyrrhus had lost 3,500 of his men, mostly irreplaceable veterans and many of his officers. Pyrrhus reportedly exclaimed after the battle "One more such victory and I shall be lost!" giving rise to the term "Pyrrhic Victory." The path to Rome was still guarded by other armies, and the Romans refused to negotiate a peace treaty. Discouraged, Pyrrhus accepted an offer from Syracuse to lead the Sicilian Greeks in their war with Carthage in 278 BC.</p>

However, upon his return, his reputation brought thousands of new recruits out to join him. With 20,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and 20 elephants, Pyrrhus once again marched on Rome. Consul Manius Curius Dentatus gathered his army of about 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse and set up camp near Beneventum to await the Epiote army. Pyrrhus decided on a surprise night attack, but some of his detachments got lost. It was morning before he could organize his scattered forces near the Roman camp. Dentatus led his forces out and drove back Pyrrhus' vanguard. As the Roman attack continued it was in turn driven back by Pyrrhus' skillful use of his elephants. However, a second Roman assault stampeded the elephants into the Macedonian phalanx. Dentatus struck while the phalanx was disordered and broke it, winning the battle. Pyrrhus withdrew from the field with what was left of his army and returned to Epirus, never to return to Italy. Beneventum was the final pivotal battle in the Roman Republic's bid for control of the entire Italian peninsula, and the first great victory of the legion over the phalanx.</p>

"CnC-A 0128 - Raphia" {
  10630
  <p>The Wars of the Successors led to the establishment of three Hellenistic Kingdoms: the Antigonids (Macedon), the Ptolemies (Egypt) and the Seleucids (from Asia Minor to India). The Seleucid Empire began to fragment, losing Judea and most of its eastern provinces and parts of Asia Minor. Antiochus III became ruler at the age of eighteen in 223 BC, and immediately began restoring his empire. In 217 he retook Judea and marched on Egypt with 62,000 foot, 6,000 horse and 103 elephants. Ptolemy IV, with a much smaller army, enrolled native Egyptians into his Greek phalanx, to bring his numbers up to 70,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry and 73 elephants. The two armies met at Raphia on the Egyptian frontier. Both armies deployed with their phalanx in the center and cavalry on the wings. Antiochus began the battle by charging forward with his right wing cavalry and breaking Ptolemy's left. The young Antiochus impetuously pursued the fleeing cavalry before him. Meanwhile, the Egyptian right swung forward into action and defeated its counterpart. With both wings wheeling in opposite directions, Ptolemy ordered his center to attack. Surprisingly, the Egyptian phalanx got the best of the veteran Seleucids and Antiochus' entire army broke and fled. Antiochus withdrew, and Ptolemy recovered Judea. Despite this defeat, Antiochus went on to re-conquer his lost provinces and restore the great Seleucid Empire. Ptolemy, on the other hand, soon faced a major rebellion led by the Egyptian soldiers he had trained for the phalanx.</p>

"CnC-A 0129 - Cynoscephalae" {
  10630
  <p>Victory in the Second Punic War (218 - 201 BC) established Rome as the dominant power in the Western Mediterranean. Since Philip V of Macedon had allied with Hannibal during that war, Rome had a score to settle. Rome used complaints from Rhodes and Pergamum about Macedonian aggression as a pretext to invade. The Senate sent Flaminius with two legions and some Greek allies for a showdown with Philip in 197 BC. This bould be the first contest between the Roman legion and a true Macedonian phalanx (Pyrrhus' phalanx had been composed of Epirotes, and Hannibal's of many nationalities). The two armies were nearly identical in size, with around 23,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry each. The battle would be won by the superior tactical system, not weight of numbers. Still, the hilly Greek terrain at Cynoscephalae did favor the legion. The two armies were marching on opposite sides of a ridgeline and met unexpectedly in the early morning mist. A skirmish began between light troops, and Philip decided to commit his entire army. Philip took command of the right wing and successfully attacked the Roman left. Flaminius seized the initiative and launched an attack spearheaded by elephants on the left flank phalanx, breaking it before it was fully deployed. Each army's right wing was now victorious. An unknown Roman tribune, 'seeing what ought to be done' detached some maniples from the Roman right to strike the flank of the victorious Macedonaian right wing phalanx. Philip's phalanx was shattered in a textbook example of flexibility versus rigidity. philip's hopes to unite the Greeks under Macedonian hegemony ended with his defeat.</p>

"CnC-A 0130 - Magnesia" {
  10630
  <p>Following his defeat at Raphia, Antiochus III campaigned continuously to restore his empire. He re-conquered Asia Minor, Armenia, Parthia and Bactria. Next, he avenged Raphia with a decisive victory over the Ptolemaic Egyptians at Panion in 199 BC. By these victories he earned the title 'the Great'. Meanwhile, Macedon's defeat at Cynoscephalae in 197 BC left a power vacuum in Greece. Antiochus, seeing an opportunity, invaded Greece, but Rome quickly drove him back. A Roman consular army under Lucius Cornelius Scipio pursued Antiochus to Asia Minor. Antiochus accepted the Roman challenge near Magnesia. Antiochus fielded a large army featuring his Greco-Macedonian phalanx, Galatian warriors, cataphracts, chariots and elephants. The Romans had two legions supported by Greek and Pergamene allies under their king Eumenes II. Though the Seleucid Army was larger, the Roman legionnaires, veterans of the war with Hannibal, were far more effective soldiers. The action started on the Roman right when Eumenes launched a combined skirmisher and cavalry force against the Seleucid chariots. The Legions then moved forward against the Seleucid phalanx. Seeing his army giving away, Antiochus charged forward with his heavy cavalry in an attempt to turn the tide. He broke through the Roman right, but was forced back by the Roman elephants before he could flank the Legions. Then the Seleucid elephants in the center stampeded, Antiochus' phalanx collapsed, and his entire army routed. Antiochus managed to escape and later make peace with Rome by yielding Asia Minor and paying a large indemnity. However, the defeat led to the rebellion of his eastern provinces, and Antiochus' life's work was undone. Rome emerged as the dominant Mediterranean power.</p>

"Panzerblitz, Hill of Death 01 - First Crack" {
  26745
  <p>On June 27th 1944, the 2/Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders of the 227th Brigade seized the small bridge over the Odon River at the town of Tourmauville. The bridgehead was reinforced into the nivht and in the morning after a short exchange with 2 Mark IVs of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment, the 23rd Hussars attempted to seize the vital high ground of Hill 112. C and B companies of the 23rd Hussars, supported by the 8th Rifle Brigade, swung around to the north and attacked down the north-south road. The British force encountered elements of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment, supported by Flak guns of the I/53 Flak battery. The Hussars seized the orchard at the top of the hill. The Germans quickly planned a counter attack with Mark IVs and Panthers. Finally, after 12 bloody hours of fighting, the British secured the only significant features on the hill. Through highly secret Ultra decrypts, Lieutenant General O'Connor and Field Marshal Montgomery learned of the release of the II SS Panzer corps to this area, and decided to withdraw the exposed elements of the 11th Armoured Division, withdrawing their forces from the heights of Hill 112 back to the Bridgehead at Tourmauville. Thus began weeks of bloody fighting around the Hill of Death.</p>

  <p>On the morning of July 10th, the 130th Brigade, supported by the 9th Royal Tank Regiment (RTR), jumped off at 05:30. The objectives for 5th Dorsets this morning were the towns of Les Dauns and Eterville, along with the ruins at Chateau de Fontaine. After quickly securing the farm complexes at Les Dauns, the British encountered stiff resistance from the 2/22 SS in the horseshoe wood and the ruins of Chateau de Fontaine. Here in the West Countrymen had their first taste of the bitter task of digging out a well-trained and entrenched enemy yard by yard. Meanwhile on the left flank, the 4th Dorsets were charged with taking Eterville, where 1/22 SS was dug in the town, its surrounding orchards, and the ridge overlooking the town. The Dorsets quickly entered the village, but fighting broke down to bloody, house-to-house fighting. The highly volatile battle caught the attention of the commander of the 5th Coy 12th SS Panzer Division, who violated his company boundaries and charged into the maelstrom, adding further chaos to an already tenuous situation. At 07:45 a message at HQ was received that Dorsets had entered Eterville and taken the town. In reality, Dorsets would spend the rest of the day and into the night trying to wrest control of the town from the SS.</p>

"Panzerblitz, Hill of Death 03 - End of Jupiter" {

  <p>Late on July 10th, it was realized that the battle to break through to the Orne River was seriously in question. In fact, the battle for the vital Hill 112 was turning into a stalemate. Maj. General Thomas decided that a fresh attack would be required to wrest control of the vital summit and the observation points looking south into the German areas. The intense fighting to the northeast had sapped most of the British reserves, leaving only the 5th Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (DCLI), which was snatching much needed rest in the outskirts of Fontaine-Etoupefour. It was decided that the gains outweighed the risk and the 5th DCLI formes up behind the positions held by 4th Somerset Light Infantry along the Caen-Evracy road. The 5th DCLI was supported by the 7th RTR, who arrived late. The 5th DCLI jumped off across the open ground to clear the remainder of the hill as the 7th RTR arrived. Elements of the 19th SS were dug in down slope and supported by miscellaneous Panzers. The battle raged up until dark, with artillery from both sides actively affecting the advantage on several occasions. The hill was secured and several heavy counterattacks were fended off into the night.</p>

"Panzerblitz, Hill of Death 04 - Take the Hill" {

  <p>The main thrust on July 10th 1944 was toward the summit of Hill 112. While the 130th Brigade secured the left flank, the 129th Brigade, supported by 7th RTR, was to advance on a broad front and secure the summit. The plan was for the 4th Somerset to advance over the summit. The 4th Wiltshire (Wilts) would swing around to the left, while the 5th Wilts swung around to the right. Things went badly from the beginning when shells from their own artillery landed among the assault troops of the 4th Wilts. Even without this stroke of bad luck, the 129th Brigade still had to advance over relatively open terrain through waist-high corn. The infantry and armour advanced in tandem. The German AT guns responded and knocked out several Tanks and Carriers. German armor quickly added to the number of British vehicles knocked out. The British forces pushed on with classic British determination, and the assault troops of the 129th closed on the German positions. The German Grenadiers opened up and began inflicting casualties on the British infantry. The defense of the Hill was declared a "Schwerpunkt" and the Germans committed their reserves - the dreaded Nebelwerfers of the 8th Werfer Brigade begin to rain death and destruction. Through all this, the British advanced slowly, yard by bloody yard, but things were about to get worse. Tigers! Elements of the 102nd Heavy Tank Brigade were advancing from the southeast. Only the thin skinned Achilles and 17 lbr AT guns of the 86th Antitank Regiment could hope to challenge this new threat. After several hours of heavy fighting, the 129th Brigade reached their goal along the Caen-Evracy road and began to dig in.</p>

"Panzerblitz, Hill of Death 05 - Overlooking Maltot" {
  26745
  <p>While its sister brigade advanced on the summit of Hill 112, the 130th Brigade jumped off on July 10th at 08:00 to secure the left flank. Intelligence reported the town of Maltot to be lightly defended, so the plan was simple. The 7th Hampshires, with elements of the 9th RTR, would advance down into the valley, pass through Maltot, and dig in on the southern ridge overlooking the town. Observation Post variants of the Churchill, along with forward observers in Carriers, would be able to quickly call in artillery support if needed, to crack the line. The advance went well until the British closed on the town, then shot and shell rang out from the village and from German AT guns on Hill 112. Compounding the situation, a platoon of Tigers from the 102nd Heavy Tank Regiment had advanced almost simultaneously to support the defenders of Maltot. The 7th Hampshires bypassedthe town defenders and thrust toward their objective, the southern heights. The 7th battalion HQ and reserve companies followed up closely with the intent of mopping up Maltot, but the Germans were not going to give up one of the few dominating features on the eastern flank of the hill. Units of the 12th SS Hitlerjugend were dispatched along the River Orne to support the eastern flank. Meanwhile the 10th SS reconnaissance, were rushed in from their marshalling areas to help stem the British tide. The German high command, seeing the situation becoming tenuous, committed elements of the 8th Werfer Brigade to bloody the British. After hours of fighting on both the hill and in and around Maltot, both sides found themselves in a stalemate. Fighting for the town of Maltot would continue over the next several weeks, with the lines ebbing and flowing along the valley floor.</p>

"Panzerblitz, Hill of Death 06 - Twilight at Maltot" {
  26745
  <p>Twelve days after the initial assault, the vital village of Maltot lies in ruins. On 22nd July, 1944, the German 272nd Infantry Division, which had arrived on foot from the Pas de Calais, was assigned the defense. The 129th Brigade would attempt to secure the village. In the vanguard were the 4th and 5th Wiltshire (Wilts), supported by the reinforced 9th Royal Tank Regiment (RTR). Operation EXPRESS, as it was known, was simply an assault from the northeast down the length of the valley. The assault kicked off at 17:30 hours, with the British advancing in line across the valley. The 4th Wilts would advance around the southern edge of Maltot, while the 5th Wilts would encircle from the north. Typhoons on station overhead could be called in to deal with any particular tough nuts. Initial progress was slow but steady, with the British securing a foothold. The Germans would still not easily give up the town, and elements of the 10th SS were sent north to reinforce the defenders, and if necessary, retake the town. Heavy panzers of the 101st were sent to support the defenders but were driven off by the rocket firing typhoons. As twilight fell on Maltot, control was still in doubt and the British command committed the 151st Royal Artillery Corps flame throwing Crocodiles to help dig out the stubborn defenders. The British fought hard into the night, finally securing the town at around 22:00. The next few hours were spent mopping up the prisoners.</p>

  <p>Clearing the crossroads at le Bon Repos was given to the 2nd Glasgow Highlanders. At 21:30 hours on July 15th 1944 they jumped off. Assisted by Monty's moonlight, the attack would advance down the slopes of Hill 112 from the northeast. The Highlanders were heavily supported by Churchills of the 107th Royal Armored Corps (RAC), 'Funnies' and Crocodiles of the 79th Armored Division, as well as machine guns and mortars of the 8th Middlesex. British forces were unsure of where the German defenders were holed up so the Churchills fired High Explosive rounds into likely defensive positions. The Highlanders cleared Esquay at around 2300 hours. At this point the Germans, believing this to be a major thrust towards Hill 113, sent the 21st Panzer Grenadiers, supported by Mark IVs of the 10th SS Panzer regiment, to blunt the perceived British offensive. The British 6 lbr AT guns went head to head with the Panzers of the 10th SS at point blank range. The British were forced to withdraw to their original starting positions on the slope of Hill 112.</p>

  <p>On July 10, 1944, the 9th Cameronians were assigned the defense of Eterville and with it the security of the left flank. Panzer Grenadiers of the 10th SS had quickly followed the withdrawing elements of the Dorsets from the town of Maltot. In the dark of night, the Grenadiers managed to work their way into the orchards around Eterville through gaps between A and B companies of the 9th Cameronians. Having penetrated into the Cameronians positions, the Grenadiers ran amok, nearly capturing the Battalion headquarters and the command staff. The left flank was now a serious concern and the Brigade Headquarters dispatched the closest reserves, C Company of the Glasgow Highlanders, to fill the gap and secure Eterville. The Highlanders fought the enemy with PIAT guns and Bayonets, finally dislodging the Germans. The 10th SS withdrew after suffering heavy casualties. However the 10th had inflicted severe losses on the British as well. For the Highlanders this was the second such blood letting in less than a month.</p>

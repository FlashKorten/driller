"Bulge 20 - The Ardennes Offensive" {
  41004
  In Bulge 20, the Allies don’t know which German strategic objective is being pursued. Allied intelligence work is required to ascertain the real German intentions so as not to overreact to the threat, because this time, the Germans can win if their staff can outthink and outmaneuver the Allies’ staff!
